 scfe_woorskyr_world.1.name: "Towering Above the Mountains"
 scfe_woorskyr_world.1.desc: "A team of our top botanists, dispatched to §Y[From.GetName]§!, has uncovered intriguing information about the now-called Woorskyr Tree. Their first discovery reveals that it's not a singular entity; rather, every tree on the planet interconnects through an extensive root network, with no other major plant life present. Secondly, the central tree, the largest one that our survey initially detected, is vast enough to accommodate entire cities within its structure. This potential has led our botanists to suggest an innovative idea: transforming the trunk and its robust, dense structure into a hub for habitation and research. They note that the tree is resilient enough to withstand significant modifications for this purpose. Additionally, there's a plethora of smaller plant species thriving symbiotically on the tree's bark, presenting further opportunities for study."

The expedition team contends that these fish are unlikely to develop intelligence beyond rudimentary instincts, primarily due to their abundant population and the relatively unchallenging nature of their oceanic habitat. Nonetheless, despite being mere animals, their unique capabilities are anticipated to be highly beneficial in various applications, pending further research."

This discovery has sparked a lively debate among our geologists and biologists about its true nature. Meanwhile, our physicists, intrigued by its unique properties, have coined it the §HQuantum Pearl§!. Remarkably, this pearl seems to be quantumly linked to every other similar pearl. When our scans detected one, they discovered all of them at once, explaining the surge in multiple readings. There is now a palpable excitement within our research community to delve deeper into the enigma of this Quantum Pearl and uncover its secrets."
