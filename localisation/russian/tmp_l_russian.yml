 scfe_subterranean.3.a: "We agree to this joint operation."
 scfe_subterranean.3.b: "We will explore this city alone."
 scfe_subterranean.4.name: "The Leftover"
 scfe_subterranean.4.desc: "Our scientists have uncovered a concerning piece of information in the Kraktanian computers. They had a contingency plan in case their master plan failed: a second cleansing device, hidden deep underground on an undisclosed planet. Though they never had the chance to activate it, the possibility that someone might eventually discover it is a chilling thought."
 scfe_subterranean.5.name: "A Request"
 scfe_subterranean.5.desc: "After much deliberation, we have decided to request your permission to colonize the abandoned Kraktanian caverns. This decision stems from our desire to learn from their mistakes and build a better future for our people. We promise to share the resources and discoveries we find there with your empire, fostering mutual growth and understanding.\nThis venture represents a significant step for us, as we reflect on what it means to take the right path forward. We hope you will support us in this endeavor and strengthen our collaboration."
 scfe_subterranean.5.a: "We grant you permission to colonize the caverns."
 scfe_subterranean.5.b: "I'm afraid we can't allow this."
 scfe_subterranean.6.name: "Subterranean Colony Established"
 scfe_subterranean.6.desc: "The [Root.GetSubMantleLower] colony ship has reached §Y[scfe_subterranean_planet.GetName]§! and the colonists have settled in the underground cities. They are swiftly constructing the necessary infrastructure to sustain their needs. An exchange area has been established to facilitate trade with our own colonists, and our scientists and engineers are welcome to visit at any time. The future looks promising for both our peoples here."
 scfe_subterranean_dig: "The Subterranean Enigma"
 scfe_subterranean_dig_desc: "During a routine mining operation, workers have broken through to a vast cavern filled with ancient ruins. The cavern appears to be an archaeological treasure trove, with remnants of an advanced subterranean civilization. The discovery is unlike anything we've seen before."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.1.name: "The Subterranean Empire"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.1.desc: "Our science team has established a base camp inside the cavern and commenced the investigation of the subterranean ruins. Early findings indicate that this civilization flourished in the planet's depths, constructing an impressive subterranean empire. Their technology is remarkably advanced, surpassing expectations. Although no remains have been discovered, environmental analysis suggests they did not rely on oxygen for survival."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.2.name: "Hidden Spaceport"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.2.desc: "Exploring another cavern within the vast underground network, our team has made a startling discovery: a hidden spaceport. Rising above it is a large opening leading to a concealed access point that allowed starships to pass through while remaining hidden when not in use. We are diligently searching for clues about this enigmatic ancient empire and its fate."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.3.name: "The Kraktanians"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.3.desc: "A fascinating crystalline computer has finally revealed information about this subterranean civilization. The §HKraktanians§! were a species of lithoids that emerged from deep within the planet's crust, gradually making their way upwards. When they breached the surface and discovered the void beyond, they were repulsed. Despite their aversion, they proceeded to explore, even reaching the stars. And the more of the galaxy they saw, the more they grew to despise it."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.4.name: "Destroyed Device"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.4.desc: "Venturing into a deeper cavern, we encounter a scene of desolation. A violent explosion seems to have originated from a massive device at the center. Upon studying its remains, we surmise it was a form of planetary shield. The destruction here hampers our efforts to uncover more information, so we have decided to move on to a larger cavern that might yield better findings."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.5.name: "Underground Capital"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.5.desc: "This massive cavern houses a major city, with tall crystalline buildings rising to the distant ceiling. After a thorough search, we uncover more information about the Kraktanians. Their expansion into the galaxy was temporary, aimed at gathering necessary resources. Once their mission was complete, they erased any trace of their passage and retreated to their homeworld, sealing it with a planetary shield. There, they began working on a plan to cleanse the entire galaxy of the alien life they so despised."
 scfe_subterranean_dig.6.name: "The Project"
 scfe_subterranean_dig.6.desc: "The Kraktanians created a device capable of reaching across the entire galaxy to dissolve all forms of life. Once the device was finished, they wasted no time in activating it. Was there a flaw in its design, or was it sabotaged? We cannot be certain, but it appears that the device's energy resonated with the planetary shield instead of passing through it, reflecting back to its generator. The deadly emanations flooded the caverns, eradicating the Kraktanians in an instant and sealing their fate."
 # Subterranean ally commentary
 scfe_subterranean.10.name: "Subterranean Envoy"
 scfe_subterranean.10.desc: "Greetings! I have been chosen to assist you in this expedition with my engineering expertise. I must admit that I am very excited to see how this species built its cities. We're seeking improved techniques to aid our development, and I am confident these findings will benefit your empire as well."
 scfe_subterranean.10.a: "Welcome!"
 scfe_subterranean.11.name: "Technological Enigma"
 scfe_subterranean.11.desc: "I am amazed at the technological prowess of this civilization. Their advancements are extraordinary, especially for an underground civilization. It makes me wonder how they achieved such heights while our own people struggled for so long before encountering your empire. There might be more to this story than meets the eye. Perhaps they had external influences or discovered something that accelerated their development."
 scfe_subterranean.12.name: "Hidden Industry"
 scfe_subterranean.12.desc: "The fact that they were spacefarers is surprising, but it explains their advanced state. I have noticed that all these engineering efforts were aimed at hiding their presence, with no infrastructure on the surface. This must have consumed enormous resources, and I feel that they lived in a state of paranoia. It seems they ventured into space not out of curiosity, but out of necessity."
 scfe_subterranean.13.name: "How we see the Universe"
 scfe_subterranean.13.desc: "The Kraktanians truly believed their subterranean environment would sustain them forever. Breaching the surface was a profound shock, and their reaction was tragically extreme. Reflecting on this, I am grateful for our own open-mindedness and curiosity when we first encountered your empire.I wonder, though, could things have turned out differently for the Kraktanians if the planet's surface had been inhabited at the time? Or were they always destined for this tragic end?"
 scfe_subterranean.14.name: "Underground Planetary Shield"
 scfe_subterranean.14.desc: "Look at this crystalline vein in the ceiling. It extends all the way to the mountain range above, acting as a conduit for the planetary shield's energy. However, the vein shows signs of a massive energy surge that must have traversed it, resulting in the destruction we see in this cavern. What could have caused such a catastrophic event? We need to uncover the source of this surge to understand what happened here."
 scfe_subterranean.15.name: "Architectural Design"
 scfe_subterranean.15.desc: "After examining the architecture of the Kraktanian city, I am truly impressed. Their use of crystalline structures to create such towering edifices is remarkable. The way they integrated their buildings with the cavern ceiling for support is a technique we could certainly learn from. Compared to our own subterranean architecture, the Kraktanians' methods display an ingenious blend of strength and elegance that could greatly enhance our engineering practices. I am not so fond of their philosophy, though."
 scfe_subterranean.16.name: "Foolish Endeavor"
 scfe_subterranean.16.desc: "The fate of the Kraktanians is clear, and it is deeply disturbing. This civilization shows us a path we did not take. While this revelation is enlightening, their folly is not what I had hoped to find. Despite this, I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in this joint operation. Here are my notes on Kraktanian engineering. I hope they prove useful to your empire. Farewell, and may our collaboration continue to bear fruit."
 scfe_subterranean.16.a: "Farewell."
