 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.1.name: "The Long Journey"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.1.desc: "Upon scanning the planet's surface, our team has discovered a decaying city within its deepest abyss. The radiation emanating from the city is so intense that it disrupts our ship's instruments, rendering navigation of the chasm impossible. Our archaeologists will proceed on foot to continue their investigation."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.1.a: "Go on."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.2.name: "The Shakzems"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.2.desc: "Nearing the bottom of the chasm lies the city. According to our team's findings, the city once floated above the abyss, but for reasons yet to be discovered, its hovering mechanisms have failed.\n\nAs the team approaches the ruins, faint sounds fill the air - voices chattering, infants laughing, and distant wails. Some among the crew believe the city is haunted by ghosts and hesitate to move forward, but the more skeptical and adventurous press on. It is then that spirit-like entities appear before them."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.3.desc: "§BFear not, travelers. We are the §HShakzems§!, and we come in peace.§!\n\nOne of the beings steps forward as a representative, reaffirming their peaceful intentions. It explains that they are the last remnants of a long-dead civilization. Intrigued, our archaeologists ask what became of their people, and so the Shakzems begin to recount the tale of Vorta and Dniki."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.4.name: "Lovers Quarrel"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.4.desc: "According to their tale, Vorta was one of the greatest scientists the Shakzems had ever known—until the day their god, Go'ldai, appeared.\n\n§BThe other Shakzems revered the entity as a deity, but Vorta and Dniki saw the truth... It was no god at all! The creature was simply a spaceborne entity, unique in the galaxy: a Nyblax!§!\n\nThey continued to explain that Vorta became deeply involved in assisting the Nyblax with its secret project. However, one day, Dniki made a horrifying discovery - Vorta and the Nyblax were using Shakzem citizens as sacrifices for their vile experiments. Thus began the lovers' tragic quarrel..."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.4.a: "Tragic."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.5.name: "The First Rune"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.5.desc: "The quarrel ended in disaster, as Vorta's crimes became public, sparking a civil war. His experiments had been focused on creating what he called §YThe Runes of Power§! - mystical runes forged by siphoning the life energy of living beings. With enough runes, Vorta believed he could create another Nyblax. While his intentions may have been noble, his methods were nothing short of monstrous.\n\nIn the end, Vorta succeeded in creating the first rune, which he named §YThe Arcane Rune§!.\n\nBut once the rune was complete, the Nyblax itself entered the conflict, laying waste to the city. It tore everything apart, killing every last Shakzem who remained."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.6.desc: "What the Nyblax did not realize was that a single rune would not be enough to fulfill its desires.\n\nDuring the war, Dniki managed to seize the rune, but it was damaged in the Battle of Ekbor. The remnants of the Shakzem civilization now hold this artifact and seem willing to offer it to us - for a price.\n\nSince the rune was damaged, it is no longer functional, meaning countless Shakzem lives were sacrificed in vain. To restore its power, another sacrifice must be made.\n\nOnly then will the Shakzems hand over §YThe Arcane Rune§!."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.6.a: "Such a complicated scenario..."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.11.name: "The Sacrifice"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.11.desc: "The Shakzems are waiting for an answer. Who should we sacrifice?"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.11.a: "It wouldn't be right if the captain didn't sacrifice himself."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.11.b: "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is too important, sacrifice somebody else."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.12.name: "The Arcane Rune"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.12.desc: "Our officer was placed inside an ancient device, where their life force was drained to complete the ritual. As soon as the sacrifice was made, the machine collapsed, and the Shakzem remnants vanished, leaving the rune behind.\n\nWhether the Shakzem were truly spirits or merely advanced holographic projections created by the device remains unclear. In the end, however - at the cost of our officer - we have obtained §YThe Arcane Rune§!."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.12.a: "A worthy sacrifice."
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.13.name: "The Arcane Rune"
 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.13.desc: "To ensure the sacrifice would succeed, we gathered a group of deviant drones and fulfilled our part of the bargain. As soon as the ritual was complete, the machine collapsed, and the Shakzem remnants faded away, leaving the rune behind.\n\nWhether the Shakzem were truly spirits or simply advanced holographic projections generated by the device remains uncertain. But in the end, we now possess §YThe Arcane Rune§!."

 scfe_ghastly_eyrie.13.hive: "Anything for the Hive."
 # Techis
 scfe_techis_init.1.name: "Destroyed System"
 scfe_techis_init.1.desc: "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! reports that the §HKhnum§! system has been devastated for some time. The cause of its destruction was not the star itself, but rather a massive energy surge that originated from one of the planets."
 scfe_techis_init.1.a: "Find out what happened!"
 # Techis Dig Site
 scfe_techis_site: "Tharkun Digsite"
 scfe_techis_relic_world_site_desc: "Long range scans reveal the system has been destroyed by a power surge that originated in planet Spleen."
 scfe_techis.1.name: "Initial report"
 scfe_techis.1.desc: "Our initial scans have proven accurate. The entire system was devastated by a massive energy surge millennia ago, obliterating every planet and collapsing the sun into a black hole. Although the planets were completely destroyed, fragments remain - some of which still bear traces of what appear to be the ruins of an ancient civilization."
 scfe_techis.1.a: "Check them out."
 scfe_techis.2.name: "Machine Worlds"
 scfe_techis.2.desc: "Our scientists investigated the ruins with the highest residual energy readings and discovered that the planet's surface was once covered in metal and wires, resembling a colossal supercomputer. This planet had the capability to host and interconnect data hubs from across its entire surface. Remarkably, some of the data nodes are still operational, and we may be able to connect our systems and hack into the planet's mainframe."
 scfe_techis.2.a: "Start the connection."
 scfe_techis.3.name: "Failing Archives"
 scfe_techis.3.desc: "Creating an interface with the planet's data stream proved more challenging than expected. Despite the difficulties, our hackers managed to access data stored within the ruined archive structures.\n\n§B'Unlocated redundancies, creating local backup...\nLoading nyblax.log...\nLog: Unidentified creature detected.\nLog: Assigning code beta alien.\nLog: Engaging defensive protocols.\nLog: Beta alien not hostile.\nLog: Commencing social interactions...'§!\n\nThe system is stuck in a loop, replaying a file labeled 'Nyblax.log.' It appears this civilization encountered an alien entity, which they began interacting with."
 scfe_techis.3.a: "Keep Reading!"
 scfe_techis.4.name: "The Nyblax"
 scfe_techis.4.desc: "The system logs were fragmented and difficult to interpret, presenting a challenge our hackers did not anticipate. However, their report confirms the arrival of a being identified as the Nyblax.\n\nFor many years, the Nyblax and the machines engaged in trade. The creature shared advanced technologies from other civilizations it had encountered, and in exchange, the machines worked to create something they referred to as The Rune."
 scfe_techis.5.desc: "According to their logs, the machines successfully created the rune, but unfortunately, no details were recorded on how it was done.\n\nBefore handing it over to the Nyblax, they decided to test the rune. Our team has concluded that this test is what triggered the catastrophic collapse of the entire system since their last log entry reads as follows:\n\n§BLog: Rune - Planetary Matrix connection established.\nLog: Initiating Rune debug.§!\n§RSystem Failing\nSaving nyblax.log\nSystem Failure\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data§!"
 scfe_techis.5.a: "Such power. Where is the Rune now?"
 scfe_techis.6.name: "The Mighty Rune"
 scfe_techis.6.desc: "Our team returned to §Y[Root.GetName]§! to search for the Rune amidst the debris. Using the ship's scanners, they pinpointed the source of the lingering energy readings. Once the course was set, the crew navigated through the planet's remains and found the Rune, drifting in the vacuum of space."
 scfe_techis.6.a: "With the Mighty Rune, how can we ever be defeated?"
 # Narrow Maze
 scfe_narrow_maze_init.1.name: "Spotted Signal"
 scfe_narrow_maze_init.1.desc: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has encountered a peculiar sight: a dragon-shaped dust cloud emanating from the planet §HNinsun§!. Long-range scanners reveal that the planet is littered with abandoned colonies, which may be worth investigating."
 scfe_narrow_maze_init.1.a: "Most intriguing."
 # Narrow Maze dig site
 scfe_narrow_maze_site: "Ruined Planet"
 scfe_narrow_maze_relic_world_site_desc: "A dragon shaped dust cloud is coming from one of the ghost cities from §HNinsun§!."
 scfe_narrow_maze.1.name: "The Ninsun Maze"
 scfe_narrow_maze.1.desc: "As the team navigates the ruins in search of the cloud's source, they find themselves lost within a maze-like city. They report sightings of towering statues and devotional murals dedicated to a being called Nyblax, all seemingly pointing toward a place of interest."
 scfe_narrow_maze.1.a: "Follow the leads!"
 scfe_narrow_maze.2.name: "The Quarri Church"
 scfe_narrow_maze.2.desc: "Our experts have pinpointed the site where the statues and paintings were directing them, leading to the source of the signal. At the end of the path stood a temple. Its architecture appears to date back to the civilization's renaissance era. Nyblax-shaped gargoyles adorned the structure, and as our archaeologists entered, they were met by a putrid stench and piles of decomposing bodies."
 scfe_narrow_maze.2.a: "What happened?"
 scfe_narrow_maze.3.name: "The Book of the Dead"
 scfe_narrow_maze.3.desc: "There were no signs of struggle, disease, or battle in the temple. It was as if these people had simply... died.\n\nOne of our scientists discovered a tome on the altar. It lay open, and one of the pages contained the following passage:\n\n§B'And by doing so, thou shalt summon the Nyblax. For his needs are above ours, and our souls shall be eternal.'§!"
 scfe_narrow_maze.3.a: "Continue Reading."
 scfe_narrow_maze.4.name: "The Dark Ritual"
 scfe_narrow_maze.4.desc: "The tome, which formed the foundation of their faith, tells the story of the Nyblax and the Runes. According to legend, the Nyblax visited the Ninsun system thousands of years ago, offering the Quarri civilization a swift path to ascension.\n\nThe ritual required a mass sacrifice around the altar, promising that through this act, the Quarri people would ascend to a higher plane of existence.\n\nThe book claims that once the ritual was complete, a Rune would be created from the soulless bodies, and the Nyblax would return to ensure their ascension had been fulfilled."
 scfe_narrow_maze.4.a: "Where is the Rune?"
 scfe_narrow_maze.5.name: "The Haste Rune"
 scfe_narrow_maze.5.desc: "Amidst the bodies of the fallen, a strange necklace was discovered, emitting faint energy pulses.\n\nIt appears the necklace once belonged to the high priest.\n\nUpon dismantling it, our team uncovered that it had been crafted by the Nyblax to harness energy from the dead in order to create the Rune. Once the Rune was complete, the necklace would signal the Nyblax to return and claim it.\n\nRemarkably, the Rune was still inside the necklace!"
 scfe_narrow_maze.5.a: "It seems we got to it first!"
 # Quad
 scfe_quad_init.1.name: "Arrhythmic Heartbeat"
 scfe_quad_init.1.desc: "Upon entering the §HKikimora§! system, our science ship have detected a powerful heartbeat signal emanating from §HM'Cholou§!. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is keen to investigate the planet."
 scfe_quad_init.1.a: "Proceed."
 # Quad dig site
 scfe_quad_site: "M'Cholou Digsite"
 scfe_quad_relic_world_site_desc: "The plannet appears to have an arrhythmic heartbeat."
 scfe_quad.1.name: "Sticky Gounds"
 scfe_quad.1.desc: "After landing on the planet's surface, we discovered that the entire landscape is a living organism. It's difficult to determine the age of the organic tissue, but based on carbon dating of some dead samples, we estimate it to be over a thousand years old.\n\nAn arrhythmic heartbeat echoes across the planet, causing the ground to tremble with each pulse. The source of the heartbeat seems to be deep within a mountain near some ancient ruins. Our team proposes investigating the ruins as they make their way toward the mountain."
 scfe_quad.1.a: "Go ahead."
 scfe_quad.2.name: "Bone Buildings"
 scfe_quad.2.desc: "As our team approached the ruins, they noticed the planet's heartbeat quickening, as if the planet itself was aware of their presence. The team reported that the structures were made of muscle, tissue, and bone - an astonishing example of organic architecture. These buildings were still alive, breathing, though no sentient life remained. The scale of the structures suggests they once housed thousands, but no other species was found.\nOur archaeologists speculate there was a mass exodus toward the mountain, where the heartbeat originates. The team pressed on.\n\nNear the summit, they discovered a tunnel of flesh, leading deep into the heart of the mountain."
 scfe_quad.2.a: "Keep moving forward."
 scfe_quad.5.name: "M'Cholou"
 scfe_quad.5.desc: "Tentacles began to encircle the exploration team as a giant, faceless creature approached. Despite its terrifying appearance, the creature showed no signs of hostility. In fact, it has started communicating with us."
 scfe_quad.5.a: "Are you the Nyblax?"
 scfe_quad.6.desc: "§BThe creature seems disappointed after realizing your team is not the entity it was expecting.§!\n\nYes, I am disappointed...\nAnd yes, I have linked my thoughts to yours, forming a bridge between our minds so we can communicate. The connection is weaker with inferior or mechanical species like yourselves, and yet, here we are.\nHow is this possible? Well... it is thanks to the Nyblax. We were once a proud and benevolent collective known as the Morthra, but now we have merged into a single, superior being."
 scfe_quad.6.a: "What is the Nyblax?"
 scfe_quad.7.desc: "§BThe creature appears irritated and frustrated by your thoughts.§!\n\nThe Nyblax... It arrived on our homeworld thousands of years ago. The creature believed we were like it—unique, one of a kind. And in a way, we were... It sought our friendship and our help.\nWhether the Nyblax was honest, benevolent, malevolent, or simply lost in hopeless despair remains unclear.\nIt wanted us to create a Rune for it, and when we did, it would return to collect it.\nYes, of course we created the Rune! How else do you think we managed to merge our entire collective into this single vessel?\nThe Rune? I have it here somewhere. I've been trying to rid myself of it for a very long time, but overpowering my own gravity has proven... rather difficult."
 scfe_quad.7.a: "Can we have it?"
 scfe_quad.8.desc: "§BOne of the creature's tentacles extends toward your team, holding the Rune.§!\n\nPlease, take it with you... Once the Rune leaves this planet, I will finally be able to die.\n\n§BThe creature pauses, a deep melancholy in its movements.§!\n\nI have been sentient for millennia, waiting for the Nyblax to return and claim the Rune, but it never came. One can only live as long as one has a purpose, and mine has long since expired. Will you do this for me?"
 scfe_quad.8.dev: "We will feast today."
 scfe_quad.8.phil: "Life is a choice, we will help you."

 scfe_quad.9.name: "The Regeneration Rune"
 scfe_quad.9.desc: "After securing §YThe Regeneration Rune§! and beginning our ascent from the planet's surface, numerous tentacles emerged from the mountain's tunnel, reaching for our ship.\nOur captain executed evasive maneuvers, successfully navigating us into orbit. As we dodged the grasping limbs and reached the stratosphere, we watched as the tentacles collapsed, lifeless."
 scfe_quad.9.a: "I guess that, in the end, nobody wants to die"

 scfe_jex_init.1.desc: "There appears to be a planet in the §HMireska§! system, orbiting a black hole. While unusual, what makes this even more remarkable is the presence of signs of civilization and flora on the planet. Without the energy of a star, it seems improbable that life could have thrived there."

 scfe_jex.1.desc: "Upon landing, our team was met with a surprisingly warm atmosphere. The air was thick with humidity, and the entire landscape was illuminated by a strange light coming from the direction of the black hole. Local flora were in full bloom, their flowers vibrant.\nThe absence of a sun left our scientists baffled. Unable to explain the anomaly, they proceeded toward a nearby city in search of answers."
 scfe_jex.1.a: "Just go!"
 scfe_jex.2.name: "The Camouflaged Lab"
 scfe_jex.2.desc: "By the time they arrived, the city had vanished! In its place stood an abandoned lab, filled with research material.\nAfter deciphering the alien language, our team began sifting through the documents. They soon determined that the lab had been established by an anthropoid species with natural camouflage abilities. The research focused on creating a device using their own DNA."
 scfe_jex.2.a: "Keep reading!."
 scfe_jex.3.name: "The Visitor"
 scfe_jex.3.desc: "According to the research notes, the anthropoids encountered a supreme being known as the Nyblax. The notes describe how the creature taught them to harness their natural abilities to create what they called a §YRune of Power§!. They allegedly succeeded and were preparing to test it at a location known as the White Spire.\nUnfortunately, most of the records detailing the creation process are too damaged to be of use, making replication impossible. Our best option is to investigate the White Spire, hoping to uncover more clues about what happened to them, their sun, and their civilization."
 scfe_jex.3.a: "Go to the site!"
 scfe_jex.4.name: "The White Spire"
 scfe_jex.4.desc: "After exploring the planet, we located the White Spire. Like the lab, the site had long been abandoned by the anthropoids.\nA digital console that controlled and logged the White Spire's activities was still functional. We accessed the logs and discovered that the rune had worked. They called it §YThe Illusion Rune§!, and according to the records, it was used to conceal the sun, transforming it into a black hole.\nThe power of the rune was harnessed throughout their labs, cities, and the planet itself—hiding, enhancing, or even creating the paradise we now see. Fearing the Nyblax's return and any hidden motives, they relocated the Rune to a place known as the Yellow Spire."
 scfe_jex.4.a: "Just get the Rune!"
 scfe_jex.5.name: "The Illusion Rune"
 scfe_jex.5.desc: "The Yellow Spire was nearly identical to the White Spire, with one notable difference: §HThe Illusion Rune§! was simply sitting in the main input system.\nIntrigued, our archaeologists examined the system's logs and discovered that, when their sensors detected the Nyblax approaching the planet, the anthropoids used §HThe Illusion Rune§! on their entire population.\nOur only conclusion is that, in their attempt to render themselves invisible, they literally vanished, as no further entries were found in the logs.\nThe team returned with the Rune, carrying tales of a lost species and the most beautiful planet they had ever seen."

The cave walls were adorned with ancient paintings that told the story of the Nyblax.\n\nIn the first set of paintings, the crew encounters the creature for the first time, receiving a gift. Our linguists interpret this as the gift of knowledge. The story continues with the crew using this gift on their home planet, inadvertently causing the death of most of their people.\nThe final set of paintings shows the crew lifting a glowing Rune, as though it were some kind of prize or achievement. When the disaster occurred, the life force of their people was crystallized into this Rune. According to the drawings, the Rune has the power to render objects invisible."
