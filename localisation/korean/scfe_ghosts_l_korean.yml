 scfe_ghost_planet.1.name: "Lost System"
 scfe_ghost_planet.1.desc: "As our vessel breaches the borders of this uncharted star system, the sensors begin to register faint signals. Scattered across the void, we detect the remains of orbital structures - probes and mining facilities, now long abandoned and eerily still. Though inactive for countless years, these relics tell the tale of a civilization that once thrived here, extracting resources from the surrounding planets and asteroids. However, it is the only habitable planet in this system that commands our attention. Something about this planet draws us in. Extracted data from a ruined communication relay gives us the name of this civilization: the §HV'inarii§!."
 scfe_ghost_planet.2.name: "Ruined Ecumenopolis"
 scfe_ghost_planet.2.desc: "The planet that lies before us was once a sprawling ecumenopolis, its surface bristling with the monoliths of a highly advanced civilization. Towering buildings stretched from pole to pole, and beneath them, layers upon layers of underground facilities thrived. Now, all that remains are ruins - silent, crumbling, and forgotten. It is a vast, dead world, shrouded in mystery.\n Exploring the entirety of this planet would take years, if not decades. However, hidden within the decaying structures and labyrinthine depths, there may be remnants of knowledge - fragments of a story long lost to time. Understanding who built this colossal city and unraveling the enigma of their downfall may reveal invaluable insights, and perhaps, a warning."

 scfe_ghost_planet.3.name: "Vanishing Stars"
 scfe_ghost_planet.3.desc: "Observational data has begun to unravel the mystery surrounding this ancient star map. As we analyzed the local area, we made a startling discovery: 3000 years ago, this sector of the galaxy was far denser with star systems than it is today. Our telescopes, after extensive effort, have observed the stars as they were back then - vanishing one after another in a rapid, unnatural sequence.\nIt took only a few months for dozens of these stars to be extinguished before the phenomenon abruptly ceased. What could have caused such a sudden and catastrophic event? We have pushed our instruments to their limits, and they have revealed a faint hyperlane, barely detectable, leading to one of these vanished systems.\nThe implications are chilling. Whatever caused these stars to vanish left behind no trace, except for this faint, hidden pathway. We must send a ship at once to investigate. The key to understanding this enigma, and possibly the fate of the V'inarii, lies on the other side of that hyperlane."
 scfe_ghost_planet.4.name: "Abandoned Mining Operation"
 scfe_ghost_planet.4.desc: "This barren planet bears the unmistakable scars of extensive mining operations. Vast sections of the surface have been carved up, leaving behind massive excavation sites where minerals were once extracted on a large scale. Scattered across these desolate expanses are the remains of abandoned mining equipment, rusted and crumbling, forgotten by time.\nOur sensors reveal that, despite the abandonment, the planet still holds significant amounts of exploitable resources beneath its surface. It's clear that the operation was halted abruptly, leaving much untapped potential behind."
 scfe_ghost_planet.5.name: "An empty system"
 scfe_ghost_planet.5.desc: "Our ship successfully crossed the faint hyperlane without any issues, much to the relief of the crew. Despite its fragile appearance, the passage proved to be more stable than anticipated. However, the relief quickly fades as we arrive at our destination - only to be greeted by an unsettling emptiness. There is nothing here.\nGravitic readings still detect the presence of a massive object where the star should be, yet it is invisible to all other forms of observation. Even more puzzling, several frozen planets remain locked in orbit around this phantom object. By all known laws of physics, these planets should have been ejected into the void.\nSomething is deeply wrong with this system. The star may be gone, but its effects linger - an enigma that defies our understanding. The crew is on edge as we prepare to investigate further. What force could have caused this, and what awaits us in the shadow of this missing star?"
 scfe_ghost_planet.6.name: "A Frozen City"
 scfe_ghost_planet.6.desc: "This planet is a desolate, frozen wasteland, shrouded in darkness and cold. Its once-thick atmosphere has long since solidified, coating the surface in a thick layer of ice. Yet beneath this frozen shell, our scanners have detected something.\nThree thousand years ago, this world was another thriving ecumenopolis, bustling with life and towering structures that stretched across its surface. Now, its vast cities lie encased in an icy tomb, their ruins preserved for eternity beneath the frozen wasteland.\nOur team has identified a promising site for excavation. Heavy machinery will be required to penetrate the layers of ice and reach the remnants of the surface. Preparations are underway as we begin our attempt to unearth this forgotten city and unlock whatever secrets it holds."
 scfe_ghost_planet.7.name: "The Unliving"
 scfe_ghost_planet.7.desc: "After extensive searching, we have finally uncovered intact data detailing the purpose of this facility. The records reveal that the V'inarii had successfully deciphered the secrets of the Order's resurrection technology and wasted no time in putting it into practice.\nTheir approach was extreme. Rather than waiting for the natural end of life, the V'inarii opted to embrace resurrection preemptively. The allure of eternal existence, combined with a body restored to its peak capabilities, proved too tempting. The population began to flock to the resurrection facilities en masse - first the elderly, then the middle-aged, and soon even the young adults. In their pursuit of immortality, the V'inarii society became obsessed with perfection."
 scfe_ghost_planet.8.desc: "The process accelerated rapidly, until, according to the data, the last living person had undergone the procedure. The entire population had been converted into a resurrected state, leaving behind no natural life forms. This facility was one of many that carried out the mass resurrection of a civilization that sought to defeat death at any cost.\nBut the records stop here. What happened after the last conversion remains a mystery, but the consequences of such widespread resurrection raise more questions than answers. What could have driven a civilization to sacrifice their living bodies for this? And what unforeseen price might they have paid for their pursuit of immortality?"
 scfe_ghost_planet.8.a: "Let's find more clues."
 scfe_ghost_planet.9.name: "The Order"
 scfe_ghost_planet.9.desc: "Another team has returned from an expedition deeper within the frozen ruins, bringing with them what could be the most crucial piece of data yet. It's a detailed military report documenting the V'inarii's final, victorious expedition against the Order. The battle was brutal and costly, exacting a heavy toll on the V'inarii's forces. However, the report does not focus on their losses but on the aftermath - a strategic triumph that brought an end to the Order.\nYet the most valuable part of the report lies not in the battle details, but in the coordinates included within: the document contains the location of the Order's home system. Whatever remains there, if anything, could hold the final answers to the V'inarii's fate and the mysteries surrounding their obsession with resurrection.\nWith these coordinates in hand, we now have a lead - a chance to uncover the truth that has eluded us thus far. If something still lies within the Order's home system, it could explain the ultimate price the V'inarii paid for their mastery over life and death. We must prepare to send a ship to investigate immediately."
 scfe_ghost_planet.10.name: "Necromantic Mastery"
 scfe_ghost_planet.10.desc: "As we prepare to venture into the Order's home system, a growing fascination with their mastery over necromantic technology has taken root within our ranks. While our own efforts in necromancy allow us to reanimate bodies as obedient, soulless entities, the Order achieved something far beyond our capabilities. They preserved the full sentience of their resurrected individuals, to the point where unlife was seen as superior to their former existence.\nOur scientists have scoured the entire facility for any clue, desperate to uncover the secrets behind their process. Yet, no surviving record of the formula they used has been found, nor have we recovered any physical samples.\nThere is only one place left where we might recover this knowledge: the Order's home system itself. Whatever remains there may hold the final key to understanding their necromantic mastery - and the promise of unlocking powers that could change the very course of our empire."
 scfe_ghost_planet.11.desc: "Once again, a faint, barely detectable hyperlane has led us to another system, also devoid of any star. The void here is unsettling, vast and empty. Unlike the previous system, this one contains only a single gas giant, orbited by a large moon that has been shattered into pieces, its fragments barely clinging together. The destruction is ancient, yet the sight of it still commands awe and unease.\nThis shattered moon is the only remarkable feature in the system, leading us to believe that this must have been where the Order made their home. But after so much time, the odds of finding anything left behind are slim. And yet, despite the devastation, this is our only lead. If anything remains of the Order's secrets, it will be found here, among the ruins of a once-great civilization reduced to cosmic rubble."
 scfe_ghost_planet.12.name: "The Order's Home"
 scfe_ghost_planet.12.desc: "Our initial scans of the moon's debris reveal a key detail - it was completely devoid of life before its destruction. This suggests that the Order's presence here was not in the form of a colony, but rather a station or base hidden within the moon itself. However, one crucial piece of evidence stands out: the moon's destruction originated from within, likely triggered by a self-destruct mechanism.\nThis act of destruction may have been an attempt to erase the Order's secrets, but it clearly didn't stop the V'inarii from stealing the resurrection technology. If they managed to extract the knowledge after the moon's detonation, there may still be remnants here, buried deep within the shattered fragments of the moon.\nWe must now explore the debris more thoroughly. The odds of finding something usable are slim, but the chance to uncover the last pieces of the Order's knowledge is worth the effort. Whatever remains in this desolate system could hold the final answers we seek."
 scfe_ghost_planet.13.name: "Hidden Station"
 scfe_ghost_planet.13.desc: "What we didn't expect to find at the heart of the shattered moon was a fully operational space station. Nestled among the debris, this ancient facility is still active. Even more astonishing, we observed drones steadily leaving the station to collect minerals from the broken fragments of the moon, before returning to deliver their cargo.\nThe question immediately arises: who could have established a mining operation in this desolate, forgotten place? As our team considers the next steps, an unexpected transmission reaches our ship. No words accompany it, just a guiding beacon - leading directly to the station's main hangar."
 scfe_ghost_planet.13.a: "Let's meet them."
 scfe_ghost_planet.14.desc: "We made the decision to enter the station. The lack of hostility from its occupants reassured us, and we cautiously proceeded toward the main hangar. Upon docking, we were greeted by a humanoid robot. Speaking in perfect, fluent tones in our own language, the robot welcomed us, stating: §HThe council is waiting for you.§!\nWithout hesitation, it began leading us deeper into the station, toward what appeared to be its central hub. As we followed, we asked how it had mastered our language so quickly. The robot answered in a matter-of-fact tone: §HWe have been observing your exploration of the V'inarii planets and gathering data from your translators. Adapting was a simple process.§!\nThe implication that we had been watched from the moment we began exploring the V'inarii ruins left the crew uneasy. Answers may lie ahead as we approach the council hall."
 scfe_ghost_planet.15.desc: "As we reach the heart of the station, we are greeted by a figure that identifies itself as the robot counselor. Its voice carries a tone of ancient wisdom and experience as it begins to speak:\n§HWe welcome you to our home. We are the remains of the Order - or rather, the machines that once maintained their station. After their downfall, we rebuilt this place and, over time, created a society of our own.§!"
 scfe_ghost_planet.16.desc: "The chilling revelation leaves us in stunned silence. The V'inarii, in their pursuit of eternal life, unwittingly condemned themselves to an existence worse than death. And now, their haunted worlds lie in the dark, their suns extinguished as a final safeguard, hiding the terrible price of immortality from the galaxy.\nThe robots escort us back to our ship, their silent demeanor adding to the heavy atmosphere of our departure.\nJust before we leave, they hand us a strange device - small, intricately designed, and humming faintly with energy. It is the final piece of knowledge from the Order that they have preserved.\n§HThis is all that remains. We no longer wish to have any link with our creators. Our path lies elsewhere - one of our own.§!"
 scfe_ghost_planet.17.name: "Departure"
 scfe_ghost_planet.17.desc: "With that, we return to our vessel, the weight of the revelations hanging over the crew. As we prepare to depart, our instruments suddenly detect a massive energy surge. In a flash, the entire station jumps into hyperspace, disappearing from the system and leaving behind no trace of its destination.\nWe have found the answers we were seeking - the truth of the V'inarii's downfall and the Order's forsaken technology - but they were far from the answers we had hoped for. The price of immortality, once thought to be a blessing, was revealed to be a curse that destroyed an entire civilization. With the knowledge we have gained, it is clear that some powers are not meant to be wielded lightly."

 scfe_ghost_order.2.name: "A Meeting with the Council"
 scfe_ghost_order.2.desc: "Before you ask - no, the resurrection technology is no more. The V'inarii sought to take it by force, and the Order let them have it, knowing well that power without mastery leads to ruin. They believed they could wield resurrection as the Order had, but without the wisdom that came with it, they were doomed to failure. As you have seen, the V'inarii reaped what they sowed, blinded by their ambition and unaware of the cost of immortality."
 scfe_ghost_order.2.a: "What cost?"
 scfe_ghost_order.3.desc: "You see, a resurrected body requires ongoing maintenance - something the Order had mastered over centuries. But they resurrected only a handful of individuals at a time, ensuring they could be properly sustained. The V'inarii, blinded by their lust for immortality, made no such considerations. When they resurrected billions, they had no knowledge of the upkeep required to maintain these new forms."
 scfe_ghost_order.3.a: "Oh oh..."
 scfe_ghost_order.4.desc: "Without the Order to guide them, the V'inarii were left to suffer an agonizing fate. Their resurrected bodies, lacking the care they required, began to decay. One by one, they crumbled into dust, their souls still trapped within their decaying vessels.\nAfter the last of their bodies disintegrated, we took action. We extinguished their suns to ensure that no one would disturb their final resting places. But even now, their worlds are haunted by the restless souls of the V'inarii - immortality denied them the peace they sought, and their spirits remain trapped, unable to move on."
 scfe_ghost_order.4.a: "An horrific fate."

# Dig Sites
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.1.name: "Eerie Ruins"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.1.desc: "We have established our base camp in the shadow of crumbling spaceport. Its structures loom overhead, casting long, jagged shadows across the desolate landscape. As our expedition begins to explore the ruins, something unsettling occurs. Flickering holographic displays - ghosts of the past - randomly sputter to life around us. Street signs, advertisements, and once-bustling market projections flash momentarily before fading back into silence. The remnants of this planet's technology struggle to remain active, their circuitry long past the point of failure.\nThe eerie flickers give the unnerving impression that this place is not entirely dead, as if the city itself is trying to remember what it once was. Yet, our scanners reveal nothing beyond damaged energy relays sparking and shorting out. It is a malfunction, nothing more... but the sensation that something here still lives remains difficult to shake."
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.2.name: "Haunted Science"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.2.desc: "We have arrived at what was once a central research hub, identified by a flickering, barely functional hologram at the entrance. The structures above ground have long since collapsed into rubble, but the facility itself extended deep underground, where the most sensitive and valuable research was conducted behind heavily reinforced walls.\nOur team has cleared a path to one of the main tunnels, granting us access to the subterranean sections of the complex. As we descend into the depths, a new phenomenon begins to unfold. The holographic security systems - long decayed - are intermittently projecting fragmented recordings of the facility's past. Ghostly figures of researchers and staff appear and disappear, walking the same corridors we now traverse, replaying sequences of their work in this place.\nThese ghostly apparitions flicker and move among us as we push further toward the central research vaults. They are merely projections, echoes of a forgotten era... but their presence casts an uneasy shadow over our exploration. It feels as if we are not alone in these depths."
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.3.name: "The Vaults"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.3.desc: "The research vaults stretch out before us, filled with dusty, abandoned experiments that cover every corner of the facility. Strange machines, oddly shaped and unrecognizable, sit in states of severe decay, their purpose lost to time. Whatever these devices were meant to achieve has long since been forgotten, their designs too alien to decipher. Our team's attempts to extract information from the ancient computers are met with partial success; the data is severely corrupted, leaving only fractured fragments of what once existed.\nOne terminal, flickering and barely functional, still displays the disjointed rantings of a long-deceased scientist. The message is incomplete, but enough remains to paint a grim picture:\n§H...we should not have attacked them. We could have found another way to... the Order's secrets after they refused... dragon destroyed an entire fleet before we... can't make sense of these debris.§!"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.4.name: "Ambition"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.4.desc: "We have reached a deeper section of the research complex, which appears to have once served as an administrative hub. The rooms here are more structured, with less of the clutter seen in the earlier sections. Desks and consoles are neatly arranged, though all is coated in dust and decay. Our team is systematically testing each functional terminal, hoping to extract any useful data from the fragmented remains of this civilization's records.\nAfter sifting through countless corrupted files, one report stands out. It appears to be a communication from a high-ranking official or scientist, filled with frustration and ambition:\n§H...are the key. You have to understand this. The Order is the sole master of this technology, and they make us pay a high price for scraps of it. This cannot continue. It is us who should rule over the...§!"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.5.name: "From Beyond"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.5.desc: "We have reached what appears to be the directorial office of the research complex. Oddly enough, it is no different from the countless other offices we've passed through - simple, functional, and devoid of the opulence one might expect from a high-ranking individual. It seems this civilization placed little value on visible displays of power.\nThe computer here, however, is in much better condition than any we've encountered so far. Our team works quickly, extracting what data remains, and there is a palpable sense of excitement as the first files are decrypted. One particular message, sent from the research director to the planet's governor, stands out. But upon reading it, we found ourselves questioning whether our translation device was functioning correctly:\n§H...you know very well that my resolve never failed during my life, and death only steeled it. My very existence today is the proof that the Order's technology must be under our control. We can't - and won't - allow them to bring anyone back from the dead without our approval... and honestly, such power should fully belong to us.§!"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.6.name: "Star Map"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.6.desc: "We have completed the data extraction from the director's computer and made an intriguing discovery - a detailed star map of the V'inarii Empire. The map is remarkably comprehensive, depicting trade routes, resource hubs, and military outposts. However, none of the stellar formations, star systems, or coordinates match any known region of our galaxy.\nThis anomaly has left our scientists baffled. Was this a hidden region of the galaxy? Or perhaps, a map of a time long past, before the galactic landscape shifted? We will need to study this map further to decipher its true origin and significance."

# Frozen Ghost site

 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.7.name: "Drilling Down"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.7.desc: "Our base camp has been established at the chosen excavation site, and the drilling process has begun. So far, everything has proceeded smoothly. Using specialized equipment, we have successfully breached the thick ice and activated thermal generators, creating a zone of warmth and evaporating the ice around them.\nHowever, the buildings here are in a far worse state than those at the previous site. The weight of the ice and the passage of time have caused extensive structural damage. Towers and spires that once rose proudly from the surface now lie shattered, their remnants barely recognizable.\nWe must proceed with caution. The weakened structures and unpredictable terrain present significant risks as we begin our exploration of this frozen city."
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.8.name: "Digging in the Cold"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.8.desc: "So far, our exploration of the area has revealed little of particular interest. Most of the structures are too damaged to provide any useful insights into the lost civilization. However, one building still stands above the others - a large, imposing medical center that appears to be relatively intact. With no better leads, we have decided to focus our excavation efforts here."
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.9.name: "The Medical Center"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.9.desc: "We have finally reached the large medical center, a structure that stands defiant against the crushing weight of the ice. Much of the surrounding area has been flattened - newer buildings have crumbled beneath the pressure of millennia. This medical center, however, is of a much older design, its architecture built to endure. Like many V'inarii structures, it extends deep underground, where its most important facilities were preserved.\nOur preliminary scans confirm that it served as both a hospital and a research center, though the extent of the work carried out here is not yet clear. As we begin our initial exploration of the entrance hall, one detail immediately catches our attention. Amid the flickering remnants of decayed lighting and malfunctioning systems, a single holographic display shines with unexpected clarity. Its message is simple yet chilling: §HResurrection§!.\nThe word pulses faintly, beckoning us toward the central section of the building."
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.10.name: "The Resurrection Facility"
 scfe_ghost_planet_dig.10.desc: "We have entered the heart of the medical center, a massive facility filled with towering machines covered in rows of pods, each large enough to hold a body. In the center of the room, a large, yawning pit descends deep into the complex, bathed in an eerie blue light. Occupying the center of the pit is an imposing structure, covered by even more pods. This facility was clearly designed for resurrection on an industrial scale. The sheer size of the machinery suggests that it was capable of treating vast populations in a short span of time.\nThe V'inarii did not merely experiment with resurrection - they industrialized it. The reason for such large-scale operations is likely stored within one of the many computers scattered around the room. We need to locate one that is still functional, but with the age and condition of this place, that will not be easy."
