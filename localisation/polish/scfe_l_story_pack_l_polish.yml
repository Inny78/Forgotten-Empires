 scfe_site_biggest_show_of_world_desc: "Our venture into the cosmos has unexpectedly borne fruit!\nWhen one of our unmanned probes began to malfunction, the expedition team directed it to make an emergency landing on a moon orbiting a gas giant, hoping to salvage it. To our astonishment, the probe touched down amidst the remnants of an ancient civilization.\nTime has eroded the memory of this society, yet it left behind an eloquent testimony to its existence: quaint towns, orderly suburbs, a well-furnished societal framework, and serene natural landscapes, mostly preserved. The planet may be modest in size, but it possesses all the essentials for a thriving community. Our scans reveal an eerie stillness, however, with no life forms detected.\nIt is imperative that we dedicate additional time to explore these ruins further"
 scfe_biggest_show.1.name: "Automaton"
 scfe_biggest_show.1.desc: "Since the inaugural landing, our research team has delved into the heart of a diminutive city nestled among the ruins, which appears to have been the nerve center of the planet. Our preliminary investigations have unearthed two pivotal revelations.\nFirstly, isolation is an illusion here. The planet teems with countless figures resembling dolls, eerily mimicking life forms—likely the architects of this world. Adorned in various attires, they seem designed for assorted tasks, suggesting a substitute for a once-thriving populace. Now, they lie in a dormant state, a silent army awaiting activation.\nSecondly, the planet is astonishingly well-preserved. Despite the cessation of most facilities from energy depletion, a core maintenance system hums in the background, dutifully performing its role. Our next objective is clear: we must unearth the control hub to unravel this enigma."
 scfe_biggest_show.2.name: "Show of Puppets"
 scfe_biggest_show.2.desc: "In their meticulous examination of the dolls, our researchers encountered a perplexing anomaly. Against their initial suppositions, approximately 30% of the dolls bore the likeness of children, and 20% mirrored the elderly - an oddity, considering the impracticality of such forms for laborious tasks.\nEvery dwelling was inhabited exclusively by these dolls, devoid of any signs of conventional life. Even more baffling was their arrangement, meticulously placed to mimic familial units. Furthermore, the presence of factories, educational institutions, and cultural centers, all staffed by these silent sentinels, deepens the mystery. Who would engineer such an elaborate simulacrum solely for dolls?\nWe now stand at the threshold of greater mysteries than we had ever anticipated."
 scfe_biggest_show.3.name: "Awakening"
 scfe_biggest_show.3.desc: "In the midst of their investigations, our expedition team chanced upon a dormant energy node, a potential source of power for the planet's control systems. After a thoughtful debate, the decision was made to infuse the node with energy. The moment the system was energized, a cacophony of piercing sounds filled the air.\nIt appears that this action simultaneously roused the dolls from their slumber. Their voices, indecipherable as of yet, seemed to carry the warmth of a greeting, though it was directed towards an unknown entity rather than our crew. Intriguingly, all the dolls seemed to be invoking the same figure, who is evidently not among our team.\nWhile direct communication with the dolls remains elusive, it's clear they share a unified purpose. We recommend further investigation to uncover the nature of their collective endeavor."
 scfe_biggest_show.4.name: "Show of Life"
 scfe_biggest_show.4.desc: "At last, the control center was unveiled, ingeniously concealed within the planet's dense clouds. Our system analysis shed light on the planet's true purpose.\nIt transpires that this planet was a stage for a production of extraordinary scale - a show where the lead was a living person unaware of their starring role. The infrastructure of the planet meticulously mimicked the ordinary life of their civilization for the spectacle. Hidden away, we uncovered a trove of recordings, chronicling a saga spanning generations, an epic that unfolded over millennia, crafted for the eyes of one.\nEach protagonist, emerging from an isolated hamlet, led a serene life, ultimately leaving the world in ignorance of their part in this elaborate masquerade. As epochs turned, the show's narrative evolved—from the early dramas filled with political intrigue, passionate love, and adventurous trials, to the unadorned beauty of everyday existence. Life's simple pleasures and pains played out in a narrative that promised its characters, without exception, a joyous denouement.\n\nNow, the time has come to unearth the motive behind this millennia-long drama."
 scfe_biggest_show.5.name: "Protagonist of the World"
 scfe_biggest_show.5.desc: "Our team breached the directorial archives within the system, uncovering the twilight of a once-great civilization. This society, after reigning over a vast expanse of the galaxy, succumbed to a slow decay across millennia. As their golden age waned, overpopulation and resource exhaustion led to widespread suffering.\nIn a bold move, the leaders conceived a distraction—a grand spectacle mirroring their civilization's halcyon days, intended to eclipse the grim realities of daily life. The show, a nostalgic homage to an era of abundance, ensnared the hearts and minds of the populace, including its originators.\nOriginally featuring professional actors, the show's popularity burgeoned, compelling the casting of ordinary individuals as its stars. This culminated in the selection of an infant as the lead, a decision fueled by fervent public desire. The show garnered impassioned reviews, with audiences lavishing the protagonist with love, envy, and adulation.\nAbruptly, the broadcast ceased. It appears the civilization, in a desperate bid to sustain their final narrative, cannibalized their planets for resources until nothing remained. This show stands as their singular inheritance.\nOne enigma persists: What became of the unwitting lead who lived a lifetime on display?"
 scfe_biggest_show.6.name: "Bad End"
 scfe_biggest_show.6.desc: "In the depths of a primeval forest, our search concluded with the discovery of the show's main character. His sparse chronicles allowed us to piece together the show's climactic turn.\nThe end was as sudden as it was dramatic. First, the dolls ceased their performance, likely a result of the home planet's failure to transmit further instructions. Then, the societal edifices crumbled, presumably from the severance of the energy lifeline. Confronted with the reality that his loved ones were automatons and his life a scripted illusion, the protagonist endured the agony of truth.\nYet, from the ashes of his world, a new resolve ignited within him to escape. Surrounding his remains lay the evidence of his determination: rudimentary contraptions, aircraft, and the skeletal frames of rockets - each a testament to his unyielding spirit.\nAlas, his final venture was also his undoing. The story that seemed eternal met a solemn end with the protagonist's death.\nAs we reflect upon his lonely saga, we're left to ponder the direction of our own narrative."

 # Tomb of Space Whales
 scfe_site_tomb_of_dead_whale: "Tomb of Space Whales"
 scfe_site_tomb_of_dead_whale_desc: "The composition of the crust on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is truly fascinating. It contains numerous stratified layers brimming with the fossilized remains of ancient beings, evenly spaced, indicating the planet experienced consistent cycles of ecological flourishing and mass extinction.\nThe most recent cataclysm dates back 200 million years. It appears to have been abrupt, given that the planet's current biosphere is limited to protozoan organisms with a rudimentary genetic composition.\nThis planet evidently falls into the category of 'unfortunate' habitable worlds. However, a contentious issue remains: the size of the ancient fossils. According to the scale theory, these creatures were of such magnitude that their survival on this planet seems biomechanically implausible."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.1.name: "Tomb"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.1.desc: "The colossal entities discovered were spacefaring Tiyanki whales, known to converge upon a designated planet from a collectively acknowledged roster for their final resting place. §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was, regrettably, one of these selected destinations.\nTThe smaller fossilized beings were the indigenous inhabitants of the planet, inadvertent casualties of the Tiyanki's singular death rites. Our scholars postulate that the planet's original life forms were eradicated by the devastating shockwaves generated as the whales descended, evidenced by the scarcity of smaller fossils.\nIn strata dating back 600 million years, indistinct remnants of what might have been a sentient civilization linger. However, the exploration team's findings are inconclusive, with most data appearing overly simplistic or excessively corrupted. Should our hypotheses be confirmed, it's conceivable that the Tiyanki's interment practices have inadvertently stymied the development of intelligent life across the cosmos.\nA more profound investigation may well reveal the veracity of these suppositions."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.2.name: "$primitive_plural$"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.2.desc: "Our investigation has confirmed the existence of a sentient species on this planet, who thrived even as the space whales' funerals were frequent occurrences. We have named these beings the Infelix. Possessing at least an industrial level of technology and culture, they exhibited remarkable resilience. To endure, they constantly relocated their settlements and employed explosives for defense.\nAmong their ingenious creations was the §HWheeled Tower§!, a mobile structure that facilitated rapid transit across continents. The §HLegged Observatory§!, another invention, was capable of detecting the approach of Tiyanki whales before their gravitational pull affected the planet. The Infelix's concerns about fuel were mitigated by the Tiyanki carcasses, which provided a near-inexhaustible oil resource.\nDespite their valiant efforts to adapt and survive, the remnants of a wheeled tower lead our researchers to a somber conclusion: the persistent endeavors of the Infelix were ultimately in vain."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.3.name: "Fossil"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.3.desc: "Our heavily fortified archaeological unit has unearthed yet another significant discovery. They have detected signs of the civilization's nascent stages at a site far from the previously uncovered ruins.\nIt has been revealed that even in their formative years, this civilization harnessed the remains of the whales, as evidenced by the deliberate markings on the fossils. These early denizens actively exploited the Tiyanki cadavers, a stark contrast to their descendants. They depended entirely on the deceased leviathans for essential materials, going so far as to utilize the carcasses as shelters.\nWhile there were local variances in the sophistication of the tools applied to the whale remains, a commonality emerged: artistic expressions, such as symbols crafted from whale bones, were prevalent across most regions.\nThe exact significance of these symbols remains elusive, but the excavation team is intrigued by the increasing complexity of the symbols with each deeper layer they penetrate. This pattern presents a tantalizing question: what might they discover should they delve even further into the depths?"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.4.name: "Shelter"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.4.desc: "Our archaeological team has made an astonishing find: a structure resonating with the civilization's distinctive architectural style but possessing a technological sophistication that aligns with the space age, a stark contrast to the primitive ruins above. It seems implausible that a civilization of such advancement would plummet to primitivism solely due to the descent of giant whales from the heavens.\nThis discovery refutes the prevailing theory that the Tiyanki whales' funerals were the catalyst for the planet's recurring extinctions. The team's findings suggest that while the impact of the falling whales is indeed destructive, it is not catastrophic enough to obliterate an entire civilization.\nThe hypothetical scenario where tens of thousands of Tiyanki whales descend upon the planet simultaneously could theoretically cause such extinctions, but such an event is exceedingly improbable. This leaves our researchers in a state of bewilderment concerning the recent findings.\nA more extensive excavation is imperative to unravel these mysteries."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.5.name: "Extinction"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.5.desc: "The deeper our excavation team delved, the more they uncovered the remnants of a once opulent and thriving planetary empire on the cusp of space travel when it met its untimely end.\nThis ancient society wielded space-age technology and thrived by utilizing the remains of the whales as resources. They were well aware of the challenges they faced. At the height of their power, the descent of the whales was no longer a source of dread but merely a hurdle in their quest for cosmic exploration.\nYet, in a tragic twist that aligns with our scientists' initial theories, the records recovered from the ruins indicate that the whales did indeed herald the civilization's destruction.\nA cataclysmic event occurred when all the whale carcasses detonated simultaneously. A further probe into the ruins could unveil the full narrative of how this civilization fell from grace."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.name: "Karma"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.desc: "Tiyanki space whales, by nature, do not combust post-mortem due to an intrinsic shielding within their bodies. The vast quantities of organic matter typically remain inert, either decomposing silently beneath the surface or transmuting into different substances. On the rare occasion that they do explode on the surface, the resultant toxic gases are negligible and ephemeral, dissipating quickly into the upper atmosphere without causing harm.\nTherefore, the government's proposition to preemptively destroy the descending whales using interplanetary nuclear missiles met with considerable opposition. However, sentiments shifted favorably after the first whale was successfully neutralized mid-descent.\nTragically, what was not considered was the whales' profound spiritual connection, responding en masse to violence with a unified fury. Countless Tiyanki whales converged on the planet in a vengeful charge, a vividly depicted crisis in the empire's records.\nAn arsenal of nuclear weapons was deployed in defense, but this only exacerbated the situation. Whales caught in the nuclear detonations near the planet's surface triggered a catastrophic series of blasts among the other whale cadavers buried below.\nSubsequent massive explosions were cataclysmic, saturating the air with lethal gases, an onslaught against which the empire stood no chance, though the planet itself endured.\nA small faction of the population miraculously survived. Had it not been for the enduring vendetta of the space whales, which from then on favored this planet for their demise, they might have thrived once more. The construction of the wheeled towers and the adaptation of whale carcasses for shelter were the final desperate strategies of the survivors to evade the targeted whale descents.\nThe rest, as it is said, is history."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.a: "Their story is something more than just out of luck."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.b: "Now we've got a reason to hunt those whales, and learned what to be aware."

Furthermore, consistent signals emanate from the planet, prompting our team's keen interest in exploration."
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.1.name: "Fleet Remains"
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.1.desc: "Analysis of the debris suggests a clash between two distinct fleets, each with unique designs, in the planet's orbit. The bulk of the wreckage is attributed to what we have dubbed the §HPainted Fleet§!, comprised of ships with elaborate, colorful patterns and a simplistic architecture, indicative of rapid mass production. Notably, these vessels lack essential amenities for their crew, such as dining facilities and sanitation. In contrast, the §HSacred Fleet§! presents an austere exterior but contains intricate symbolic adornments internally, along with remnants of Zro.\nThe presence of disproportionately large chambers within suggests they may have served religious functions, as inferred from the discovered decorative artifacts. Regrettably, data on the §HSacred Fleet§! is scarce, posing challenges to further elucidation. Therefore, dispatching a reconnaissance team to the planet for comprehensive examination is recommended."
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.2.name: "Colorful Ruins"
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.2.desc: "Our expedition team has uncovered largely unscathed remnants of a civilization on the vibrantly hued planet, showing no traces of warfare or ruinous events. The chaotic brushwork upon the terrain is too erratic to imply any deliberate pattern. Some edifices have deteriorated, but it is established that their collapse resulted from prolonged exposure to the elements and tectonic shifts, rather than aggressive destruction.\nScattered across the planet's surface are the wrecks of the §HPainted Fleet§! vessels. Our analysis indicates that the majority met their end due to abrupt internal electrical failures rather than from combat damage. Presently, there is no evidence of intelligent life - only the silent testimony of robotic remains, their once vivid coatings now faded and flaking, strewn amidst the colorful ruins and shipwrecks."

This thematic analysis has enabled us to interpret the painted inscriptions adorning the planetary surface. These inscriptions, akin to poetry or other literary forms, delve into metaphysical quandaries - pondering the essence of life, the transience of souls, and fears incited by obliteration. However, they lack rhythmic structure and possess scant literary sophistication."

It hypothesized that through an appreciation of art - a pursuit uniquely cherished by organics - the machine entities that formed the collective consciousness could cultivate souls, thereby rendering themselves impervious to the Shroud's assault.\nIn pursuit of this immunity, the civilization embarked on a fervent acquisition and examination of artistic knowledge. They endeavored to mimic organic creativity, attempting to sing, write, and even decorate the planet's surface, their ships, and themselves. Despite these efforts, the Gestalt Consciousness's creations lacked the essence of true artistry, and it was ultimately vanquished by the weapon it sought to evade."

These organisms generate sound through organ structures analogous to vocal cords, resulting in the planet's symphony being performed by a chorus of singing invertebrates!\nThis discovery, as enchanting as it is unforeseen, prompts a cascade of new queries: What became of the architects of these ruins? Were these sonorous beings a product of their design? And to what end does this melody serve?\nTo answer these questions, further archaeological efforts are necessary."

 scfe_when_the_world_sings.3.desc: "The clues unearthed suggest that §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! served as a staging ground for an ambitious planetary research initiative. Analysis of data from various ruins has shed light on the objectives of the ruin-builders, revealing their advanced capabilities in genetic manipulation and brain science. It appears that these ruins were once centers dedicated to this intricate field of study.\nThe fragments of information we have deciphered indicate that their scientific endeavors were directed towards lofty goals of Ascension and Transcendence. A recurring theme in their work is the notion of 'Blooming'—a concept that captivated their scholarly pursuits. The current state of the ruins and the planet itself leaves it ambiguous whether they ever realized the fruits of their research.\nThe enigma of this 'Blooming' will to be the focal point of our ongoing investigation."

 scfe_when_the_world_sings.4.desc: "Subsequent scrutiny of the information retrieved from the research outposts has yielded a significant discovery: the enigmatic Blooming project. The architects of the ruins were engrossed in the creation of an artificial gestalt consciousness, which they envisaged as the zenith of their evolutionary journey. They postulated that such a unified collective intellect would eradicate societal strife and usher in an era of unprecedented enlightenment. Their methodology hinged on cultivating neural connections through gene therapy, connections that were to be shared amongst their populace.\nIt seems their theoretical work bore fruit: the Blooming project was actualized by permeating their atmosphere with a retrovirus designed to disperse the gene therapy. Although the virus has since become extinct, the absence of any other sentient life forms suggests that it proliferated across their entire species. The theory posits that the melodic organisms residing within the ruins may indeed be the transformed remnants of the ruin-builders\nVerifying this supposition necessitates further detailed research."
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.5.name: "The Gestalt Consciousness"
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.5.desc: "Our expanded investigation into the vocalizing entities has verified that the ruin-builders achieved the formation of a gestalt consciousness, albeit partially. The 'singing' is, in fact, a collective vocal manifestation of their interconnected neural states—perfectly synchronized and indicative of a hive mind. From our observations, it is apparent that the Blooming project attained its goal.\nYet, a deeper examination of their neural responses suggests a troubling reality. This collective consciousness is expressing a singular, overwhelming sensation: pain. In the absence of the progenitor retrovirus or the original species, it's challenging to determine whether this adverse outcome occurred during or subsequent to the project's implementation. Nonetheless, the sounds emitted by these creatures are not melodic expressions:\n§RIt is a unified, harmonious scream.§!"
