 scfe_the_first_music_anomaly: "The First Music"
 scfe_the_first_music_anomaly_desc: "While exploring §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we repeatedly received a very strong signal. Our scientists claim that violent solar winds have been observed in the star system, but this signal is not from natural factors such as solar wind.\n\nOur scientists have determined that this is an artificial signal, and given how easily we found it, it seems that we need to study this signal."
