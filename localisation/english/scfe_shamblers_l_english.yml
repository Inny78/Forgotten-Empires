 scfe_shamblers_chain_desc: "We have discovered the remnants of an ancient alien civilization within this system, indicative of their activity roughly 17,000 years ago. Our scientists have pieced together information that suggests these aliens, nicknamed §SShamblers§!, were a migrating species that regularly moved to new systems."
 scfe_shamblers_clues: "$scfe_shaded_clues$"

 scfe_shamblers_init.1.desc: "One of our exploration probes has detected an anomaly in the §Y[shamblers_colony1_system.GetName]§! system. We should investigate it before someone else finds it."

 scfe_shamblers.1.name: "Abandoned World"
 scfe_shamblers.1.desc: "Our science ship has detected widespread structural remains on the surface of this world. Preliminary scans suggest it was once home to a technologically advanced civilization, long since vanished.\nThe ruins appear undisturbed, preserved beneath layers of sediment and regrowth. An on-site study is being prepared to investigate their origin."
 scfe_shamblers.3.name: "DNA Analysis"
 scfe_shamblers.3.desc: "Continued analysis of the biological remnants recovered from [shamblers_colony1_planet.GetName] has yielded a breakthrough. After eliminating contamination and reconstructing fragmented sequences, our scientists have determined that the so-called Shamblers were not a single species.\nThe genetic material shows clear evidence of two distinct biological lineages. The next site along their path may offer more intact samples—and more answers."
 scfe_shamblers.4.name: "Deserted World"
 scfe_shamblers.4.desc: "Once again, we have encountered a habitable world abandoned by its inhabitants. Scattered infrastructures suggests a once-thriving civilization.\nA comprehensive planetary scan has identified a particularly well-preserved site suitable for excavation. Our team is preparing to begin surface operations."
 scfe_shamblers.6.name: "DNA Mystery"
 scfe_shamblers.6.desc: "The latest round of DNA analysis has yielded troubling results. As with the previous findings, the remains indicate the presence of two distinct species. But this time, one of them is a genetic match for a species from the first exodus. Despite clear genetic alignment, there is no similarity between them. By every external measure, they were entirely different. Yet their genes tells a different story.\nWith this discovery, our course shifts once more. The third set of coordinates lies ahead, and with it, the hope that the pattern may finally break... Or be explained."
 scfe_shamblers.7.name: "Solitary World"
 scfe_shamblers.7.desc: "Once again, we have found a habitable world left behind - its cities in ruin, its people gone. The signs are familiar now: vacant infrastructure, intact but lifeless systems, no trace of conflict. We are preparing to deploy an expedition to the surface. But this time, we know what to look for.\nThe pattern is becoming clearer - and more disturbing."
 scfe_shamblers.9.name: "Body Snatchers"
 scfe_shamblers.9.desc: "Comprehensive DNA assays indicate that, prior to the last exodus, this world hosted a single sapient species. Immediately thereafter, near-identical individuals begin to appear - matching the natives in morphology and behavior, yet bearing a wholly different genome: the same Shambler profile recovered on earlier worlds.\nOver the following decades the originals vanished from the record. The substitutes occupied their homes, vocations, and identities, maintaining institutions as if nothing had changed. When long-range surveys registered another spacefaring civilization elsewhere in the galaxy, the pattern concluded in the same way: a coordinated, total departure."
 scfe_shamblers.10.name: "Lone Moon"
 scfe_shamblers.10.desc: "We have reached the coordinates of the last exodus, but the planet below is uninhabitable - its surface scoured by a cataclysmic impact approximately 5,000 years ago. A continent-scale basin, vitrified plains, and deep ejecta fields attest that whatever stood here was erased.\nYet the trail has not gone cold. Sensors register a faint, coherent energy signature from an abandoned installation on the airless moon - a base empty of life, but not yet without power."

 # Shamblers Dig Sites

 # Amphibians
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig: "$scfe_shamblers.1.name$"
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig_desc: "The abandoned ruins of an ancient colony, abandoned 17,000 years ago."
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.1.name: "Abandoned Colony"
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.1.desc: "Our science team has established a base camp amid the ruins of a vast metropolis. The layout and surviving infrastructure indicate a civilization well-versed in interstellar travel - no fewer than eight spaceports once operated here, each capable of supporting sustained off-world traffic.\nYet not a single vessel remains. Yet not a single vessel remains. Hangars gape empty, launch pads are bare, and the control towers stare sightlessly over the silent ruins.\nThis world was was abandoned. Despite its intact infrastructure and ideal habitability, the entire population left - deliberately, and entirely."
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.2.name: "The Shamblers"
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.2.desc: "Analysis of fragmented databanks recovered from multiple sites has yielded images of the native inhabitants. They appear to have been mid-sized, dark-blue amphibians with elongated torsos and an unusual method of locomotion - short, bounding movements across the ground.\nTheir self-designation is unpronounceable in our language, its phonetics resisting accurate replication. In its place, the excavation team has adopted a working name: §HShamblers§!, taken from their distinctive, loping gait."
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.3.name: "Exodus"
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.3.desc: "Data recovered from one of the spaceport's computer systems indicates that all vessels departed for a single destination. Cross-referencing star charts and archived transmissions reveals that another spacefaring civilization had been discovered there.\nThe announcement was met with overwhelming enthusiasm. The earliest voyages were on a small scale at first. But over time, the departures increased. New ships were constructed at an industrial scale. Additional spaceports were commissioned. Eventually, the entire population left.\nNo evidence of war, environmental collapse, or economic necessity has been found. They did not flee. They chose to go. What remains unclear is why."
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.4.name: "Lack of DNA"
 scfe_shamblers_colony1_dig.4.desc: "Due to the planet's active biosphere, remarkably little biological material remains in the areas surveyed. DNA fragments recovered from habitation zones are degraded and genetically inconsistent.\nWith few answers left to uncover here, our team has calculated the exodus trajectory. All available data points to a specific system, identified as the destination of the departed population.\nWe are preparing an expedition. What eluded us on this world may yet be revealed at the next."

 # Mammals
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig: "$scfe_shamblers.4.name$"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig_desc: "The deserted ruins of an ancient colony, abandoned 14,000 years ago."
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.1.name: "Deserted Colony"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.1.desc: "We anticipated to find some continuity, traces of the same civilization that departed the previous world en masse. But we found none. Aside from the familiar presence of multiple spaceports, nothing on this world resembles what we observed before. The architecture is alien in form and function, bearing no stylistic or structural link to the colony we've been following.\nWe are deploying multiple teams across the primary ruins to conduct a more extensive investigation."
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.2.name: "A New Species"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.2.desc: "Recovered records and skeletal remains indicate that this world’s former inhabitants were small, fur-covered mammals. Our science team notes - purely as an observation - that their appearance would likely be considered endearing by most sapient species.\nThey possessed remarkable engineering skills, with a particular mastery of miniaturizing even the most complex devices. Many of the surviving artifacts are exquisitely compact, their internal mechanisms a marvel of precision craftsmanship."
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.3.name: "City Archives"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.3.desc: "Our teams have uncovered the city's central archive—a vast repository of historical records, personal logs, and institutional data. It is a treasure trove of information, and analysis is already underway.\nThe records cease abruptly around 14,000 years ago, coinciding with the evacuation of the planet. As with the previous world, this departure was not one of desperation but of eagerness. The population anticipated it with enthusiasm, viewing it as a natural and necessary step.\nThe catalyst, once again, was the discovery of another spacefaring civilization. And once again, no explanation was recorded. The decision was so universally accepted, so self-evident, that no justification was considered necessary."
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.4.name: "No Trace"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.4.desc: "What troubles us most is not what we've found - but what we haven't. There is no record of contact with another civilization. No transmissions, no ambassadorial exchanges, no mention of alien sightings. According to the data found on $scfe_hotuma_kuran$, billions came here during the first exodus. Yet there is no trace of them. Were it not for the identical pattern of departure, we might have assumed we miscalculated the coordinates. But the evidence is clear: this was the intended destination.\nWe have conducted extensive scans across this star system. They are not here.\nSo where did they go?"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.5.name: "The Second Exodus"
 scfe_shamblers_colony2_dig.5.desc: "Our excavation teams have recovered and analyzed numerous skeletal remains from across the settlement. The results are conclusive: none of these individuals belonged to the species that left their homeworld during the first exodus. Whoever lived here, they were not the original migrants.\nWe have identified a new destination based on spaceport data and system references.\nAs our ship prepares to follow this new trail, our researchers are conducting thorough analysis of the remains using the ship's equipment.\nWhatever is happening, it is not random. We need answers."

 # Insectoids
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig: "$scfe_shamblers.7.name$"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig_desc: "The solitary ruins of an ancient colony, abandoned 10,000 years ago."
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.1.name: "Solitary Colony"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.1.desc: "With our base camp established, the team wasted no time initiating fieldwork. Using low-orbit scans, we identified several key locations for investigation, and deployed specialized teams to each.\nOne has entered a massive administrative structure - likely a central institution of this civilization. Another is excavating a burial ground, where we hope to obtain preserved biological material for comparative analysis. And the third has been dispatched to the planet's primary spaceport facilities, where we expect to uncover records of off-world activity... and, perhaps, the next destination."
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.2.name: "Too Much Information"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.2.desc: "This species appears to have used multi-functional buildings extensively, and this vast structure is no exception. Government offices and administrative centers occupy the upper levels, while lower tiers contain a commercial hub and a curated exhibition of art and cultural artifacts.\nUnlike previous ruins, the facility is remarkably well-preserved - systems are stable, structures intact, and data access points still viable. For once, we are confronted with an overwhelming volume of information.\nTo efficiently survey the most critical sections, the team has divided once more."
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.3.name: "False Continuity"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.3.desc: "The most unexpected discovery came from the art exhibition.\nFor thousands of years, the native insectoid species developed a distinct and complex artistic tradition - intricate symmetry, layered resin carvings, and chemically-reactive pigments. But 14,000 years ago, the artwork changes abruptly. The newer pieces bear no resemblance to the older style. Instead, they closely match the aesthetic and thematic patterns recovered from the first abandoned colony. At last, we have found a clue linking the two species. But this link does not suggest contact or imitation - it suggests something else. We'll need more data before we can draw any conclusions."
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.4.name: "Preserved in Amber"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.4.desc: "Burial practices among this species involved encasing the dead in a resinous substance similar to amber - an organic compound that has proven remarkably effective at preserving biological material. These remains represent our best opportunity to extract unaltered DNA across multiple time periods.\nWe have recovered specimens spanning millennia, carefully dated and catalogued to reconstruct patterns of genetic continuity - or divergence.\nThe most difficult task was to uncover bodies dating back to the previous exodus, thousands of years before this planet's abandonment.\nFull analysis will require time. But the implications could be significant."
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.5.name: "Next in Line"
 scfe_shamblers_colony3_dig.5.desc: "As with the rest of the settlement, the spaceports are in excellent condition. The native species, it seems, incorporated a glandular resin into nearly every material - concrete, plastometal, glass - lending their structures a strange organic sheen.\nOf greater interest are the active holographic arrays still looping outbound migration announcements. The displays name a spacefaring reptilian civilization as the next destination—identified across several information terminals as §Hthe perfect match for assimilation§!. The coordinates of this target system are repeated constantly, etched into terminals, cargo manifests, and visual media.\nMost disturbing of all is an holographic message still flickering: §HWe will feast again!§!"

 # Reptilians
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig: "$scfe_shamblers.10.name$"
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig_desc: "The lone ruins of an ancient colony, abandoned 5,000 years ago."
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig.1.name: "Lone Moonbase"
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig.1.desc: "Secondary impacts have shattered the moon’s surface; most installations were pulverized. One structure endures - a solitary station spared by the cataclysm. We have established a base camp beneath a shielded dome and dispatched recon teams to map the surrounding area.\nPreliminary assessment identifies a scientific outpost that once expanded into extensive subsurface galleries. Those sections have likely collapsed under the quakes that followed the planetary impact. The upper levels remain sealed. Technicians are assembling an industrial laser cutter to breach the locked main airlock and gain entry."
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig.2.name: "The Listening Ward"
 scfe_shamblers_colony4_dig.2.desc: "With the main airlock breached, we begin a methodical sweep of the station. It divides into several purpose-built sectors; the first proves to be a long-range monitoring suite devoted to cataloguing intelligent life. After field repairs, limited power is restored.\nThe central display flickers to life, resolving a projection of the local galaxy. Within minutes the array harvests live emissions—then isolates signals from our own empire. Archived logs confirm that, at abandonment some 3,000 years ago, no such entries existed.\nOne by one, subsystems come online: acquisition routines, decryption protocols, triangulation. The console resolves transponder signatures and fixes the coordinates of our homeworld. This civilization was very efficient at selecting targets."
