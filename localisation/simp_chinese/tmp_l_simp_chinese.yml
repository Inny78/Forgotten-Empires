 scfe_inasir_category: "Signal detected"
 scfe_inasir_desc: "We are receiving a weak signal emanating from the surface of this uninhabited planet."
 scfe_inasir.1.name: "Underground Complex"
 scfe_inasir.1.desc: "While looking for the source of the signal on §Y[From.GetName]§!, our sensors have uncovered a labyrinthine network of subterranean structures. The site has been flagged for further archaeological investigation."
 scfe_site_inasir: "$scfe_inasir.1.name$"
 scfe_site_inasir_desc: "We have uncovered a labyrinthine network of subterranean structures."
 scfe_inasir_dig.1.name: "Excavation Report"
 scfe_inasir_dig.1.desc: "A base camp has been successfully established on the planet’s surface. Preliminary surveys have identified multiple entry points to the ancient underground structures, though all have suffered severe collapse over millennia. Our team has selected the most stable of these and begun the delicate process of clearing the debris. Initial progress is slow, but promising."
 scfe_inasir_dig.2.name: "Warehouse"
 scfe_inasir_dig.2.desc: "The cleared entryway has granted access to a colossal subterranean warehouse. The chamber is filled to the ceiling with towering stacks of metallic ingots. However, initial analysis has revealed a perplexing discovery - the metal is highly brittle, consisting of a haphazard blend of incompatible minerals that render it entirely useless. Despite their apparent worthlessness, the ingots were meticulously stored here, leaving us to question the purpose of this enigmatic cache."
 scfe_inasir_dig.3.name: "Manufacturing Complex"
 scfe_inasir_dig.3.desc: "We have breached the interior of a vast underground manufacturing complex, now lying in ruins. This facility once drew magma from the planet’s core to forge the alloy ingots we've discovered. It was clearly capable of mass production, though much of the foundry has now collapsed into uncharted depths. The surviving machinery bears signs of crude modifications: quality control systems have been deliberately bypassed, seemingly in a desperate bid to maximize output at the expense of material integrity."
 scfe_inasir_dig.4.name: "Hangar"
 scfe_inasir_dig.4.desc: "Our team has reached another collapsed tunnel, revealing a series of colossal hangars once connected to a now-ruined spaceport. The scale of these facilities suggests that they regularly received massive cargo ships, each capable of transporting thousands of tonnes of alloys in a single trip. Analysis of surviving computer records reveals that the primary client for these shipments was the First League."
 scfe_inasir_dig.5.name: "Administrative Sector"
 scfe_inasir_dig.5.desc: "Our expedition has breached into a secured section of the facility, identified as the administrative hub of the complex. Though it was once fortified with defensive systems, the passage of time has rendered them inactive. Beyond the director's quarters, we encountered an unexpected find: a vast databank complex, far exceeding the scale required for a manufacturing site of this nature. Intrigued by the potential secrets stored within, our team has begun the painstaking process of analyzing the data."
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.name: "Databank Analysis"
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.desc: "To say our scientists are baffled by the contents of the databanks would be an understatement. Upon further examination, the true nature of this vast data repository became clear - every single entry is a complaint regarding the substandard quality of the alloys produced by the Inasir Corporation. The sheer volume of grievances stored here is staggering, reflecting a level of dissatisfaction that rivals the scale of the operation itself."
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.a: "Why did they keep them?"
