Perhaps it hides a gift for the primitives, a storage room with technology for them to receive when they managed to reach the level of intelligence needed to breach the door, or maybe it hides a scientific facility, still operating after all these years? Whatever the answer, we probably won't know until we have breached the door."
 AAA_arcsite.40.name: "Advanced Species"
 AAA_arcsite.40.desc: "Having breached the door, our archeologists got to work quickly, exploring the bunker behind it. So far it appears that the bunker was made as a kind of facility, though we still don't know for what purpose, as its only contents seem to be random every-day items. It, however, also contradicts all of our current theories, indicating that the civilization was technologically advanced, only regressing to a more primitive state after the shielding event."

After the isolation, the whole civilization slowly regressed to religious primitives.\n\nThe Isolator itself was found in the basement of the bunker, its fission-based reactor having slowly run out of usable fuel, leaving an unsteady and unstable power source."

The easiest way to gain access would be to blow the door up, or use a laser to cut it open. Alternatively, [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested dismantling it carefully, in order to study it more closely."
 AAA_arcsite.70.a: "Blow it up"
 AAA_arcsite.70.b: "Bring in the lasers"
 AAA_arcsite.70.c: "Dismantle it carefully"
 AAA_arcsite.71.name: "Disturbing Purpose"
 AAA_arcsite.71.desc: "After gaining access to the bunker, it became clear this wasn't some ordinary bunker intended for refugees or a nuclear war, or a military bunker for storing war materiel.\n\nInstead what the crew of the [Root.GetName] found was blueprints for an antimatter bomb of the size of a small moon."
 AAA_arcsite.71.a: "Proceed as normal"
 AAA_arcsite.71.b: "Scan the blueprints and send them to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]"
 AAA_arcsite.72.name: "Race against the clock"
 AAA_arcsite.72.desc: "During further investigations of the military bunker on [From.Planet.GetName], [Root.GetLeaderName] has found a clock counting down, set to reach 0 on [FromFrom.AAA_bomb_time]. The countdown is currently assumed to be for an antimatter bomb as depicted on the sketches we found earlier."
 AAA_arcsite.72.a: "We must act quickly"
 AAA_arcsite.73.name: "Confusing Hallways"
 AAA_arcsite.73.desc: "During the exploration of the bunker, it has become clear that the hallways and rooms of the underground part of the facility where the bomb is assumed to be stored in was made to be as confusing as possibly. [Root.GetLeaderName] fears we may not find the bomb in time if it's still active."
 AAA_arcsite.73.a: "Unfortunate"
 AAA_arcsite.74.name: "The Control Room"
 AAA_arcsite.74.desc: "Good news from [Root.GetLeaderName] has arrived: the control room for the antimatter bomb has been found. Seemingly endless rows of wires, buttons and computers line the wall, and it may take some time before [Root.GetLeaderName] figures out a way to deactivate it."
 AAA_arcsite.74.a: "Finally some good news"
 AAA_arcsite.75.name: "The Fate of a Planet"
 AAA_arcsite.75.desc: "After extensive investigation of the control room, [Root.GetLeaderName] has narrowed down the choice down to the severing of one of three colored wires. One will stop the countdown, but snipping the wrong wire could activate the bomb prematurely."

 AAA_arcsite.77.desc.b: "Apparently, the bomb depicted in the blueprints had been constructed, but not used. It is assumed that [event_target:dead_scientist.GetName] and [event_target:dead_scientist.GetHerHis] somehow triggered the device while exploring the bunker."
 AAA_arcsite.77.desc.c: "[event_target:dead_scientist.GetName] and [event_target:dead_scientist.GetHerHis] team are assumed dead, as they were on the [event_target:AAA_antimatter_planet.GetPlanetMoon] at the time of the detonation."
 AAA_arcsite.77.desc.d: "[event_target:dead_scientist.GetName] is assumed to have cut the wrong wire, resulting in the destruction of the [event_target:AAA_antimatter_planet.GetPlanetMoon]."

 AAA_arcsite.78.desc.b: "Apparently, the bomb depicted in the blueprints had been constructed, but not used. What caused it to detonate is as of yet unknown."
 AAA_arcsite.78.desc.c: "It exploded as the countdown reached 0, just as predicted."

 AAA_arcsite.79.desc: "In what can only be described as a few, nerve-wracking seconds, [event_target:savior_scientist.GetName] held the cutting device in [event_target:savior_scientist.GetHerHis] [event_target:savior_scientist.Owner.GetSpeciesHandName], before cutting the wire. What followed was a sigh of relief from [event_target:savior_scientist.GetHerHis] team as nothing happened, a sign that [event_target:savior_scientist.GetName] had chosen the right one."
 AAA_arcsite.79.a: "A close call"
