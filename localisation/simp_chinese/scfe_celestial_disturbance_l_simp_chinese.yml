 scfe_celestial_init.1.desc: "An optimization in our hyperlane detection systems allowed us to notice a faint hyperlane that previously eluded us, allowing the detection of an unexplored solar system."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.2.name: "A Disturbed System"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.2.desc: "Upon entering the system, our ship's scanners detect an unusual celestial configuration. At its center lies a striking binary composed of a neutron star and an M class star. The orbits of the planets within the system appear highly irregular, suggesting that the neutron star is a recent arrival, having caused significant gravitational disturbances. The crew is eager to begin a thorough exploration to study the consequences of these changes and uncover any secrets this system may hold."
 # Clues
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.3.name: "A Frozen World"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.3.desc: "Our team think that this planet wasn't originally so far from its sun, and the scans confirms it. The planet §Y[From.GetName]§! is now a frozen wasteland, its surface covered by a kilometer-thick layer of ice. Scans indicate that it was once habitable, orbiting closer to its sun before being flung to its current distant orbit by the gravitational upheaval caused by the neutron star's arrival. Deep below the ice, your scanners detect the remnants of ancient structures, suggesting that an advanced civilization once thrived here. However, excavating these ruins will require significant resources and effort. But that's not all..."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.4.name: "A Curious Experiment"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.4.desc: "On this moon, we have detected a science complex of great interest. The main laboratory of the moon base contains an impressive and enigmatic device. After a thorough investigation, §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! determines that this device was part of an ambitious experiment to generate a hyperlane. The lost civilization had attempted to create their own pathways to the stars but ultimately failed, abandoning the research as the neutron star's arrival forced their priorities to shift."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.5.name: "A Disturbed Giant"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.5.desc: "This gas giant still shows signs of the passage of the neutron star in this system. The scan of §Y[From.GetName]§! reveals that the gas giant has undergone significant changes due to the neutron star's disruptive influence. The gravitational upheaval has caused the planet to lose most of its moons. Some were ejected from the solar system, while others strayed too close to the giant and were torn apart, forming a spectacular ring system around it. We have found some rare minerals among the debris and gathered them."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.6.name: "A Lonely Moon"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.6.desc: "Among the remnants of the gas giant's once numerous moons, only one has survived in orbit. Scans of this moon reveal traces of an ancient mining operation, now heavily damaged by a meteoric bombardment. The site is largely destroyed, leaving few clues behind."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.7.name: "A Melted World"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.7.desc: "§Y[From.GetName]§!, now the closest planet to the binary suns, was once situated further away. The arrival of the neutron star has dramatically altered its orbit, bringing it perilously close to the intense heat and radiation emitted by the stars. The planet's surface has melted, becoming an infernal landscape. Any traces of former structures or life have been obliterated, leaving a barren, molten wasteland."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.8.name: "The Original Star"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.8.desc: "§Y[From.GetName]§!, the original star of this system, now shares its course across the galaxy with the wandering neutron star. Over time, the immense gravitational pull of the dead star has siphoned off some of this star's matter, altering its composition and behavior."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.9.name: "The Wandering Star"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.9.desc: "This neutron star is the primary cause of the dramatic disturbances within this system. Its intense gravitational field periodically attracts matter from its companion, leading to explosive reactions when enough matter accumulates. Fortunately, current scans indicate that such an event is not imminent."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.11.name: "A Tear in Reality"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.11.desc_1: "As our team concludes their scans of the planet, they detect a thin breach in the fabric of reality itself, hanging at some distance above the planet. This anomaly is unlike anything they have ever encountered. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is baffled by the strange phenomenon. It appears as a thin, wavering breach in the fabric of space-time, emitting faint, fluctuating energy readings. The true nature and origin of this anomaly remain a mystery, as our sensors can't make sense of it."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.11.desc_2: "As our team concludes their scans of the planet, they detect a thin breach in the fabric of reality itself, hanging at some distance above the planet. §G[Root.GetLeaderName]§! recognizes the phenomenon as a type of astral scar, similar to those previously encountered. However, this one is unusual in its smaller scale and its position deep within the gravity well of the solar system. Despite their familiarity with such rifts, the scanners are unable to make sense of this one, and for now, there is little that can be done to interact with or study it further."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.12.name: "Secrets under the ice"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.12.desc: "With the entire solar system now fully explored, our attention turns to the frozen world of §Y[scfe_celestial_disturbance_homeworld.GetName]§! and the ruins that lie buried beneath the ice. These ruins may hold crucial answers to the mysteries surrounding this system and the lost civilization that once thrived here. A more in-depth exploration is needed to uncover the secrets hidden within."
 # Dig site
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig: "$scfe_celestial_disturbance.12.name$"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig_desc: "$scfe_celestial_disturbance.12.desc$"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.1.name: "Base camp established"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.1.desc: "A base camp has been established on the surface of §Y[From.planet.GetName]§!, directly above the largest visible ruins at the north pole. Scanners indicate a pocket of hot air beneath the ice, suggesting that the city below has not been crushed by the weight of the ice. With the machinery in place, the team is ready to begin drilling down to uncover the secrets hidden within the ancient ruins."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.1.a: "Start excavating."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.2.name: "Hot Air"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.2.desc: "The science team has been diligently excavating a vast city entombed beneath the ice. As they near their objective, they encounter peculiar conditions. The previously detected pocket of air around the city is extremely hot, causing the ice to melt. This pocket is actually filled with hot vapor, necessitating additional precautions before breaching it. The alien city ruins now lie exposed, continuously drenched by a warm rain and enveloped in hot vapor. Donning protective gear, the team stands poised to explore the city and unravel its mysteries."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.3.name: "Melted Well"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.3.desc: "It did not take long to identify the heat source: a large, incandescent well descending deep into the ground. At its bottom, scanners have detected a substantial amount of molten metal, remnants of an ancient reactor that appears to have overloaded. This well is situated directly beneath the center of the dimensional rift orbiting above the planet - a correlation that cannot be coincidental. The explanation for this phenomenon must lie somewhere within the city's remains."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.4.name: "The Museum"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.4.desc: "The harsh conditions complicate the exploration, prompting the team to split up to cover more ground. One group enters a large structure, which turns out to be a museum. While the ancient history of this civilization has been largely obliterated by time and water, they manage to access a sealed room that recreates this society's space exploration efforts. At last, our translation devices have something to work with."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.5.name: "Isolated"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.5.desc: "The tale of the §HZe'tanians§! is one of profound tragedy. They advanced to the brink of galactic exploration, yet were thwarted by a lack of hyperlane connections in their solar system, leaving them isolated. Despite their efforts, including attempts to create an artificial hyperlane, every endeavor failed. As a deeply united people, they were unwilling to send slow colony ships with cryogenically frozen individuals, as the thought of being permanently separated from them was unbearable."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.6.name: "Last Resort"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance_dig.6.desc: "Another group reports from a mostly destroyed scientific complex. They have pieced together the final chapter of the Ze'tanians' story. Upon detecting a wandering neutron star approaching their solar system, they realized their doom was imminent. Desperation fueled their research, leading to a breakthrough: the creation of a rift to an alternate universe. Once the passage and destination were deemed safe, they evacuated their entire population through the rift to this new universe."
 # Conclusion
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.13.name: "Conclusion"
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.13.desc.a: "We now have a clear understanding of the events that transpired in this solar system. Ironically, the neutron star that sealed the Ze'tanians' fate also brought with it an hyperlane, reconnecting this system with the rest of the galaxy."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.13.desc1: "$scfe_celestial_disturbance.13.desc.a$ The question of the rift remains an enigma. All their research has been destroyed, leaving it far beyond our current understanding. Perhaps the future will reveal the answers the Ze'tanians discovered."
 scfe_celestial_disturbance.13.a: "Perhaps indeed."
