 scfe_alshigans.asteroid.name: "The Alshigan Civilization"
 scfe_alshigans.asteroid.desc: "The Alshigans, an avian species, commenced their galactic exploration eight centuries ago. Their remarkable adaptability enabled them to colonize a diverse array of planets, potentially facilitating a rapid expansion across the stars. However, their progress was hindered by their primitive FTL technology. Despite their resourcefulness, they developed a functional engine based on an unconventional concept nobody would have thought to study. Regrettably, this approach led to a dead end, permitting only short-range travels before requiring several days for engine recharging."
 scfe_alshigans_savannah.name: "Trails in the sky"
 scfe_alshigans_savannah.desc: "Though certainly unconventional, the spatial propulsion engines of the Alshigian ships were a remarkable sight, leaving a lengthy trail of pure energy in their wake as they traversed the skies.

 scfe_sless.2.desc: " The planet's cities seem to have been designed for citizens of various sizes, which concludes that the alliance is a federation of multiple different sentient species. As there are no signs of destruction or bodies in the cities' remains, our scientists believe that the inhabitants abandoned this planet and moved to another one. Our investigations have revealed depictions of at least 20 different alien species, ranging from mammals to arthropods. Among those species, a reptilian species with four arms stand out with more descriptions, which possibly means they were the leading species of the alliance.\n\n Among our findings was the spaceport of the planet.

It seems there had been a clash between an armed force and unarmed ones, in which the armed force already fortified the spaceport and its surroundings. Social scientists presume the conflict might have rooted in the alliance's multi-ethnicity, as it is quite common for multi-ethnic empires to experience such conflicts among different species.\n\n According to the data our scientists could gather, the alliance's central government had decided to abandon the planet but had failed to evacuate all of its citizens. The fate of those left behind is not known. However, our team has identified the coordinates of their destination. It might prove useful in finding out the truth about what happened."

 scfe_sless.6.name: "Chapter II"
 scfe_sless.6.desc: " Our scientists found out more about the cultural aspects of the alliance by studying the data gathered from the cities' remains. The civilization had access to extremely advanced biological knowledge and have used the said knowledge to enhance themselves biologically. Downtown areas of the cities have brochures that promote biological enhancements like "Trend of This Month! : Compound Eyes!", which implies that physical reconstruction was extremely common.\n\n In addition, a highly fortified building was discovered in the city ruins. The countless battle makers imply that the defenders had valiantly fought but failed, as can be seen from the destroyed entrances. More about the fate of this civilization could be learned by investigating this area."
 scfe_sless.6.a: "Investigate with caution."
 scfe_sless.7.name: "Chapter III"

 scfe_sless.7.a: "Analysis of data authorized."
 scfe_sless.8.name: "Chapter IV"
 scfe_sless.8.desc: " According to the data, the downfall of this civilization was brought upon by disease, not by violent mass protests or civil war, as initially thought. This contagious disease-which the scientists referred to as the raging epidemic-caused the infected to turn violent in a fit of rage. Logs found in the headquarters show that the central government's desperate efforts to stop the situation from spreading across the alliance had failed.

Most of them are presumed to be the ones that had been shot down in space combat. But surprisingly, some have been analyzed to have come out of the ground.\n\n The remains of the ships that had come out of the ground share a unique pattern of destruction. Half of the hull remains intact without signs of explosion or penetration, but the other half is completely shattered into pebble-sized bits. As our explorers on the field describe, the sturdiest armored ships had been broken in pieces like glass would.\n\n The sight of the relatively intact body of the vessel covered by pebble-sized broken pieces resembles the pebble-filled slope of a rocky mountain. It would need explorers to get up this sooty mountain."

They were the navy of the Coprean Constitution, a republic that existed 1.6 million years ago.\n\n Although ships from other species were also found, most of the Coprean ships had been destroyed by Coprean weapons, which led our team to think that there was a civil war between the Copreans, and alien civilizations joined in the fight.\n\n According to the operation references found on the alien ships, the Coprean Constitution has been in decline for tens of thousands of years after its golden age. It took isolationism as its diplomatic ideology during the decline, and newer empires came to call it the fallen empire. It probably didn't have the strength to revive itself after the civil war, which sped it up on its way down.\n\n Personal record terminal units are scattered inside the Coprean ships as if they want to be seen. It seems that recording was a deep-rooted obsession for the Copreans, as can be seen from the fact the soon-to-be-dead personnel tried to record what happened amidst the panic and confusion inside the falling ship.\n\n The terminals deleted the recordings after a while without being used, which seem to be a military security measure. However, our team could try to gather and combine the scattered data to explain."

At this moment in the Coprean Republic, political turmoil was at its highest with their ruling and opposition parties, namely the 'Goldens' and the 'Philosophers' fighting fiercely. However, the amendment of the constitution-which originally had been the main issue of the conflict-was passed roughly and hastily, and both parties ordered each other to disband. Eventually, the situation escalated into a coup and then into a civil war.\n\n Having been on the losing side for a while, the opposition party broke away from their isolationist ideology. They established an exile government in the confederation of inner galaxy empires and asked for their help. The federation, which had been looking for an opportunity to gain influence in the Coprean Republic, agreed immediately and joined in the fight as the opposition party's ally. However, the ruling party did not stand idly but created a new federation uniting the outer galaxy empires. The civil war was now the world war. The battle site is only but a tiny sample of the war. Although the information gathered is not enough for our scientists to identify the winning side, they have concluded that the Copreans civilization met its demise because of the war.\n\n The story of the Coprean is bigger than our initial anticipation. More studies will be conducted on the Copreans on many more excavation sites, even after the ship's secrets remain to get solved.\n\n Our explorers have discovered a ship pretty deep down under. It seems that it stopped while it was being shot out from the ground."

They were only able to 'submerge' for a short period, but it was quite enough to launch surprise attacks. If they had been used actively, the paradigm of war would certainly have changed.\n\n But the Copreans had long-lost knowledge of designing a submarine, and no one knew how to drive it correctly. As a result, the submarine with wrong navigation warped inside the gravisphere nearby, in other words, in the middle of the planet's crust. Half of the ship's body shattered like pieces of glass, stuck between dimensions. The Copreans barely managed to recover the knowledge on how to build submarines by the end of the war.\n\n A religious writing has been found on the terminal in the captain's quarters, that he wanted his eye plucked and buried on a planet when other people managed to find his body. Along with it was a prayer that congressman Innovo would revive the Coprean glory.\n\n Several civilian cargo ships that were hidden behind other ship remains have been found. It seems the planet originally had been used as a resting place for traders. We were also able to get a set of coordinates for a certain planet. It must be the planet that the captain mentioned earlier. The coordinates were found among the documents inside a cargo ship.

Since the planet is distorting signals to disguise itself as a gas giant, our drone will report that the gassy atmospheric storm had destroyed it.\n\n The data didn't provide us with the knowledge on how to turn off the massive holographic image, but it is highly probable that the power switch might be somewhere easy to find."

Perhaps the Copreans installed a device that only allows survival only for plants and fungi?\n\n However, the planet is extraordinarily fertile, which gives off the notion of it being a farming planet. Some scientists argue that it was a terraformed planet for vegetarians. Their quite a rash explanation suggests that the danger of civil war caused the terraforming process to end prematurely, and the planet's magnetic field was too weak to hold the atmosphere.\n\n An ecosystem can not prosper without animals to balance itself.

All the plants on the planet are mockup. Exotic trees, beautiful autumn colored mountain, flowers swaying with the wind, countless nameless weeds- everything single one is actually a skillfully crafted plastic mockup with preservatory coating.\n\n The rivers and the oceans are made up of acidulous distilled water with no minerals: the soil and the rocks of colored neo-concrete. No life forms of any kind are found here. It's an uninhabitable illusion.\n\n Our close-range scanners have detected over two hundred artificial caverns hidden behind the artificial bush.

Some of them were unfortunate and got lost.\n\n At the end of the visitor-repelling maze was a vast, unmeasurably huge empty cave. As our team shone flashlights, they could see countless building ruins in the dark. Massive pillars were supporting the cavern's roof, beside the endless ruins of the underground city.\n\n It is unclear if this is the correct description, but the undergrown city is spread out over all the planet's crust. The place where our explorers landed was, in fact, a massive shell built above the planetary city.\n\n A relic world hidden under the guise of a continental world, also hidden under the image of a gas giant.\n\n Did the Copreans want to hide the city from other species? But to do so, hiding the city under the guise of a barren planet would have been way easier.\n\n It will take more time to finish the expedition."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.7.desc: " This planet was the home planet of the avian species, the Avus. The Avus observed 21 different primitive civilizations while maintaining the principle of non-involvement. However, as their population kept declining, they decided to enlighten one of the primitive stone-age civilizations and incorporate them into their empire. They were the Copreans that, even in stone-age, got attention from the Avus with their superb intelligence.\n\n At the end of Avus' history, more than 90% of their population was Coprean, as the Avus' population kept declining and the Copreans kept multiplying, both for hundreds of years. Data gathered from a memorial stone describes the last days of the Avus. An alien empire initiated a surprise invasion, and their capital planet was surrounded. The hurriedly constructed Coprean fleet had won them the decisive battle, and a peace treaty was signed. The Avus, however, already went extinct with the fall of their capital.\n\n The Avus' civilization and technology transferred to the Copreans, which led them into the greatest days of their history. Since the Coprean Republic's establishment, their scientific knowledge and level of financial wealth soon exceeded the Avus' by far. The vast fake forest surrounding the ruins is a coffin and an offering of flowers for the Avus, built during the golden age of the Copreans. The maze and the gas giant disguise was protection against undeserving thieves.\n\n The Copreans used the isomer-plastic to keep them maintained after tens of thousands of years, even after losing most of their technologies.\n\n Meanwhile, an interesting phrase of words has been found in the terminal which was sitting before the memorial stone. It said the opposition party eventually agreed upon euthanasia, and the Copreans no longer deserved to cherish this place, along with coordinates pointing to a hideout for the Copreans who might visit in the future."

The builders hollowed out the planet, then terraformed the inside and replaced the gravity with centrifugal force. The habitat was made to be self-sufficient for a small number of dwellers.\n\n The habitat, however, is encroached on by weird-looking planet, fungi, and a creepy layer of creep, which led us to think that the plants went wild after the inhabitants were gone. It's now a hive world of some sort but isn't really posing a threat since the plants are all dead.\n\n Why did they build such a hideout? Why did they write down the coordinates?

The exiles expected patriots to visit the home planet of the Avus even after the fall and left the coordinates to invite them to their little revival movement.\n\n Most of the refugees were members of the opposition party. They were deemed political criminals by the ruling party and left home. As their homeland suffered more and more as time went by, the exiles became sick of the current corrupt republic. They tried to rebuild the Avus empire with congressman Innovo as the new emperor, who had been still working hard to prevent the republic's fall.\n\n The most recent resolution described three epidemics the ruling party had contaminated the republic with and their will to eliminate those. The first of the three was religion, but the second and third item is illegible.\n\n According to our research on the rotten plants, the time of the plants' outburst coincides with the period where no more recordings were made.

They were practically essential in the hideout, where medical facilities were at best mediocre. Since no recordings after the creep's breakout exist, that's about all we could find about the hideout. However, we can draw from what we've seen that the creep's ability to survive and invasive capabilities were unexpectedly strong and eventually caused the hideout's downfall.\n\n Our explorers have identified the location of the Coprean home planet. Our first archaeological findings suggested the existence of such a planet, but since there were so many ways of calling the planet, which we presume to be a part of their culture, our researchers were confused.

Its environment is devastated beyond the point of no return during the process in which the buildings replaced the forest. Our city engineers argue that this 'Suicidal City' should not be classified as an Ecumenopolis, the arcology epitome.\n\n This kind of thoughtless development is a characteristic common in mechanical planets, but Magnasanti isn't one of those. Apart from the environment, the buildings themselves are a sophisticated complex of advanced construction technology and luxurious amusement facilities and parks that organic creatures like are everywhere.\n\n However, the planet lost all of its water, atmosphere, and geological energies and became an utterly barren planet, on which no one should be able to cultivate.\n\n It seems that a new city had been built after the civil war devastated the planet, as can be drawn from the remains of destroyed buildings and intact ones being together.

The towers of life were the symbols of Coprean egalitarianism and wealth that the empire could maintain such a high level of the social security system for all of its citizens. During its golden age, the towers meant eternal lives and eternal prosperity.\n\n Thus, they lived eternally. The towers did not allow anyone to die. Although the extremely old had to spend most of their time asleep inside the life support devices, they were able to meet their family and participate in events on special occasions, thanks to the stimulants.\n\n When the election day became the only day they wake, the eternal prosperity ended. The number of people inside the towers exceeded the people on the outside, and the politicians only needed to win the tower residents' votes. Once the prospered empire of the Copreans became a laughing-stock. Luckily, the number of the vote coming from the towers was declining slowly.\n\n However, the decline didn't last long, and the tower votes began to increase. No one had seen the tower residents actually vote, but well, hey, it's secret voting. People outside wanted reformations, but the principle of equality bound them, and the manipulated elections are now a mere subject the politicians bring out to avoid talking about actual problems.

Pro- and anti-amendment demonstrators fiercely clash multiple times, and the religious circles bombarded Innovo with insults that he was trying legalize euthanasia. In support of the ruling party, the press argued that the opposition party controlled the religious groups by taking advantage of the people's admiration for the Avus and the anxiety about the declining economy.\n\n Right before the voting began, Innovo revived a set of laws which had been practically dead for tens of thousand years. Firstly, local governments must supervise religious activities involving critical patients. Secondly, the central government can browse through the supervisors' documents if local governments neglect the management of sanitary facilities. Using those laws, he was able to uncover the linkage between the opposition party and the new religious cult, then ordered the opposition party to disband after a summary trial. Resistance and suppression soon followed, and the voting was delayed for a week."

The majority of the citizens who were in support of the constitutional amendment died that day.\n\n According to a civilian history book, the amendment was approved by a tiny difference in votes. But the Tower of Life was no longer the central issue. Congressman Innovo had declared martial law, which was soon followed by the opposition party's terrorist attack on the presidential palace, leading to a civil war. Surviving citizens were either crying out for the nation's glory and the victory for Innovo, or crying out for the judgment to him and the second coming of the apocalypse. The war between the dictator and the fanatics spread throughout the galaxy as the opposition party established an exiled government in the inner galaxy.\n\n Our explorers were able to secure a copy of the resolution at the closed undersea base, where the exiles were occupying. It described the three diseases as religion, euthanasia, and suspicion. The public's suspicion began when the opposition unveiled Innobo's doppelganger. The opposition party claimed to have found the real Innovo locked up in a space prison cell, and the ruling party is, in fact, using a hologram of Innovo to instigate the whole Coprea.\n\n The ruling party, which had only been maintained solely by Innovo's charisma, was split over the incident, and the opposition party gained power with their fleet's decisive victory against the ruling party.

Coprea lacked resources to build a fleet, but the federation was in no better shape due to a war of attrition with the outer galactic federation. They had no choice but to recognize Coprea's independence as they could not deal with the guerrilla warfare the Copreans were putting on.\n\n Both the Coprean Constitution and its home planet were devastated, fallen far down from their golden age. The Towers of Life and the patients were both out of power. Innovo was nowhere; there were only rumors that he had been assassinated at the end of the civil war.\n\n However, Coprea was able to revive itself off of its advanced technology. The home planet's rebuilding proceeded smoothly with resource extraction and the economy back on track, along with the leftovers from the golden era. Unfortunately, at the same time, a new psychological disease has silently taken root in the revived empire.\n\n Copreans saw their home planet thrive in their dreams every night and began to suffer from collective hallucinations. Strangely, they felt stable on skyscrapers but felt extreme stress when they were in places with no buildings. The Copreans used all of their remaining strengths to cover their entire home planet with cities, and no one was there to stop them even when the environmental damage and pollution caused serious damage. The Copreans entirely filled their planet with cities, destroying themselves in a ridiculous manner in the galaxy. Even when the end eventually came, they were still relieved to see their home in such a state.\n\n Even after the Copreans went extinct, the cities have developed on their own and consumed all the planet's resources, turning it completely barren."

Was it Just for fun?\n\n It turned out that Innovo was an immortal with psionic power and that he has been alive since the time of the Avus.\n\n Galaxies are vast, and more amazing things happen in real life than in novels, and hardly believable conspiracy theories sometimes turn out to be true. It has just been reaffirmed how mysterious sentient beings are. What about you, our beloved leader? Does our empire hold secrets that we can't imagine?"

 scfe_coprean_constitution.15.desc: " The Avus is the Coprea, and the Coprea is Innovo. The Copreas constitution is a republic, a dictatorship, and a...\n\n Collective consciousness.\n\n The Avus' collective consciousness of profound intellectual curiosity and sensibility discovered that joining with the primitive civilization of Coprea would create incredible synergies. If you order them to act autonomously, they will mimic sentient beings. Believing that such was the true path of evolution, the collective consciousness abandoned the body the Avus and became the Coprea.\n\n The collective consciousness, which took a long time to understand sentient beings, was no longer a collective consciousness, but society itself. The Copreans believed that they were truly free, but the Coprean society was, in fact, a literal living creature. The Copreans knew that there were unexplainable strange parts in their history, but when they tried to investigate further, 'the whole society' refused it.\n\n Their fear deep inside of them forced them to record their feelings and wills to identify themselves, obsessively. They convinced themselves that they had witnessed the integration of a society that their desire for equality and idealism gave birth."

Only sentient societies can be divided. Only a sentient being worships ancestors and has religious beliefs. A sentient being cannot live in a hive world. Only sentient beings commit foolish acts of self-destruction. Coprean wanted to prove their existence by dying.\n\n Our researchers have decrypted the last mystery in Innovo's diary. The study of existentialism turned out quite satisfactory. The collective consciousness returned the design of submarines to autonomous entities and ordered a war of independence in order to eliminate troublesome outside interference.\n\n But while planning a new experiment, the collective consciousness must have found a better species than the Copreans. It soon decided to abandon Copreas and transfer to a new species.\n\n Announcing our findings will instill unforgettable fear among the citizens that our empire may actually be merely the puppets of such collective consciousness and that our free will may be all but an illusion.

They were able to project images to show fake big cities, to hide the real ones. They resided in areas that had been known to be small cities or in underground cities, which allowed them to gain the upper hand in protecting themselves from espionage or even orbital bombings. They also seem to have been using the projectors to create holographic images in everyday lives.\n\n Among the records were the coordinates of planets where the projectors had been sold.

Astanine forts were being taken by the Tistra one by one, while a small group of brave Astanine warriors sacrificed themselves near this planet, fighting until the end. Our scientists played the footage.\n\n The result was unexpected. The Astanine admiral cleverly projected fake images of their fleet, and the enormous Tistra fleet fired upon their allies, fooled by the holographic fleet, which eventually led to Tistra's defeat.

After defeating the Tistra with their advanced holographic technologies, The Astanine had enjoyed peace for a while. However, the empire leaders couldn't fight the temptations coming from such technologies as well as they did the Tistra. They first began by creating holographic fleets and holographic police forces.\n\n Then they began to assassinate citizens with 'opinions' and replaced them with holographic images containing artificial intelligence. The people of the empire noticed the government's tyrannical behavior and staged a planet-wide revolt. The government could successfully suppress the rebellion, using their superb holographic technologies to cause inner conflicts among the rebels, without even resorting to the use of military force. The surviving rebels managed to gather to this planet and continued to fight against the government.\n\n They attacked the battle site with the Tistra, and then finally advanced towards the homeworld of the Astanine.

The rebels built a permanent residence on a corner of the star system to prepare for prolonged battles, using most of their resources.\n\n §H<<We want freedom! We want the truth, not just holograms!>>§!\n\n Shouting their slogan, the rebels fought hundreds of battles against the government forces. But eventually, they ran out of resources, and being unable to keep up with the advanced holographic technologies didn't help. Twenty years after the war began, the rebels were finally eliminated by the government's fleet.\n\n This is the last information we can get. We need to look for the basement to find more details."
