 # Vanishing Act
 scfe_vanishing_act.1.name: "Initial Assessment Report"
 scfe_vanishing_act.1.desc: "Upon entering the orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!, our vessel has identified multiple indicators of an advanced civilization. The presence of numerous artificial satellites and several large space stations in stable orbits is a clear testament to the technological capabilities of the inhabitants. Remarkably, these structures appear intact and functional, but show no sign of activity.\nMoreover, a comprehensive scan of the planet presents a perplexing scenario. Despite the visible urban infrastructure on the surface, including sprawling cities and complex transportation networks, there is a complete absence of any electromagnetic transmissions, typically characteristic of advanced societies. Even more perplexing, our scanners have failed to detect signs of life or any movement on the surface. This eerie silence raises significant questions about the status of the civilization and merits further investigation. We are preparing to initiate a closer reconnaissance mission to gather more data on this unusual and unsettling situation."

 scfe_vanishing_act_dig_desc: "We discovered a world devoid of its inhabitants. What happened here? We must investigate this mystery."
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.1.name: "Empty Stations"
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.1.desc: "During our exploration of the nearest space station orbiting §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!, we encountered a series of bewildering discoveries. The station, while structurally intact and fully operational, was completely devoid of inhabitants. It appears as though the crew and occupants departed abruptly, or more unsettlingly, vanished, just prior to our arrival. Personal belongings, operational consoles, and life support systems are all in a state suggesting a sudden, unanticipated exodus.\nThe most alarming discovery, however, pertains to the docked spacecrafts. Every docking bay is occupied, indicating a mass return of all ships to the station. Analysis of the vessels' black boxes reveals that each ship's automated systems were triggered to execute a standard emergency protocol: return and dock at the nearest station in the event of pilot unresponsiveness. This protocol activation suggests a simultaneous and widespread event affecting all pilots and crew members.\nWe are currently departing the space station to commence a direct exploration of the planet's surface, specifically targeting urban centers for further investigation. The nature of this phenomenon remains deeply perplexing, with no immediate explanation for the sudden disappearance of an entire civilization. Caution and thorough analysis will be our guiding principles as we proceed."
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.2.name: "The City of a Thousand Songs"
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.2.desc: "Upon landing near a major urban center on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!, we have commenced an extensive ground exploration. The city is a vast ghost town, mirroring the unsettling abandonment witnessed on the space station, but on a far grander scale. Streets are lined with stationary vehicles, and dwellings show signs of abrupt desertion. The infrastructure and technology level of the Vaanclars, as we have come to identify the planet's inhabitants, is impressively advanced, yet eerily silent.\nOur translators have successfully deciphered the Vaanclar language, allowing us access to their digital archives. Interestingly, the Vaanclars did not rely on visual perception; instead, they developed a sophisticated form of echolocation, using a symphony of sounds to navigate and interact with their environment. This unique sensory approach means there are no visual records or images of the Vaanclars or their disappearance. We have located what appears to be a major archive facility, potentially housing extensive historical and scientific data. We are preparing to enter this archive with the hope of uncovering more information about the Vaanclar civilization and the circumstances surrounding their mysterious vanishing."
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.3.name: "Investigation at the Vaanclar Archive"
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.3.desc: "Our investigation within the Vaanclar archive has provided crucial insights, albeit shrouded in the mystery of this civilization's sensory perception. The archives, meticulously maintained and remarkably comprehensive, offer a wealth of knowledge, although much of it is attuned to sensory experiences alien to us. Nonetheless, our technology has allowed us to decode the basic content of their records.\nThe most significant discovery pertains to a recent and monumental scientific endeavor described as §Hlistening to a greater chant§!. This phrase is associated to an experiment conducted at a primary research center.\nIt seems that the entire Vaanclar population was engrossed with this project. The records abruptly end following the initiation of this experiment, with no further updates or outcomes documented. This sudden cessation of records coincides with the timeline of their disappearance. We are now en route to the specified research center in hopes of uncovering more concrete information regarding this experiment and its potential consequences."
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.4.name: "The Greater Chant"
 scfe_vanishing_act_dig.4.desc: "Our exploration of the Vaanclar Research Center has led us to a groundbreaking discovery. The facility, a testament to the Vaanclars' mastery of sonic sciences, was primarily focused on harnessing harmonics to potentially breach the boundaries of our known reality. The center's extensive records, still accessible through their operational systems, detail an ambitious and unprecedented experiment: to use a chorus of psionically gifted individuals to emit a chant capable of piercing through to higher dimensions.\nUpon successfully unlocking the central chamber of the research center, we encountered a phenomenon beyond our current scientific understanding. Inside an isolated vault, we were met with an overwhelming and inexplicable sound – a harmonious choir that seemed to consist of billions of voices, and a tear in the fabric of reality at the heart of this chamber. However, as we delved deeper, the tear began to show signs of instability, compelling us to evacuate the area swiftly to ensure our safety.\nThe most haunting aspect of this encounter, as we ran to our ship, was the realization that the voices comprising this otherworldly chorus were unmistakably Vaanclar - and they came from beyond the rift."
