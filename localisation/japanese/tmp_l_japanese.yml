 scfe_inasir_category: "Signal detected"
 scfe_inasir_desc: "We are receiving a weak signal emanating from the surface of this uninhabited planet."
 scfe_inasir.1.name: "Underground Complex"
 scfe_inasir.1.desc: "While looking for the source of the signal on §Y[From.GetName]§!, our sensors have uncovered a labyrinthine network of subterranean structures. The site has been flagged for further archaeological investigation."
 scfe_site_inasir: "$scfe_inasir.1.name$"
 scfe_site_inasir_desc: "We have uncovered a labyrinthine network of subterranean structures."
 scfe_inasir_dig.1.name: "Excavation Report"
 scfe_inasir_dig.1.desc: "A base camp has been successfully established on the planet’s surface. Preliminary surveys have identified multiple entry points to the ancient underground structures, though all have suffered severe collapse over millennia. Our team has selected the most stable of these and begun the delicate process of clearing the debris. Initial progress is slow, but promising."
 scfe_inasir_dig.2.name: "Warehouse"
 scfe_inasir_dig.2.desc: "The cleared entryway has granted access to a colossal subterranean warehouse. The chamber is filled to the ceiling with towering stacks of metallic ingots. However, initial analysis has revealed a perplexing discovery - the metal is highly brittle, consisting of a haphazard blend of incompatible minerals that render it entirely useless. Despite their apparent worthlessness, the ingots were meticulously stored here, leaving us to question the purpose of this enigmatic cache."
 scfe_inasir_dig.3.name: "Manufacturing Complex"
 scfe_inasir_dig.3.desc: "We have breached the interior of a vast underground manufacturing complex, now lying in ruins. This facility once drew magma from the planet’s core to forge the alloy ingots we've discovered. It was clearly capable of mass production, though much of the foundry has now collapsed into uncharted depths. The surviving machinery bears signs of crude modifications: quality control systems have been deliberately bypassed, seemingly in a desperate bid to maximize output at the expense of material integrity."
 scfe_inasir_dig.4.name: "Hangar"
 scfe_inasir_dig.4.desc: "Our team has reached another collapsed tunnel, revealing a series of colossal hangars once connected to a now-ruined spaceport. The scale of these facilities suggests that they regularly received massive cargo ships, each capable of transporting thousands of tonnes of alloys in a single trip. Analysis of surviving computer records reveals that the primary client for these shipments was the First League."
 scfe_inasir_dig.5.name: "Administrative Sector"
 scfe_inasir_dig.5.desc: "Our expedition has breached into a secured section of the facility, identified as the administrative hub of the complex. Though it was once fortified with defensive systems, the passage of time has rendered them inactive. Beyond the director's quarters, we encountered an unexpected find: a vast databank complex, far exceeding the scale required for a manufacturing site of this nature. Intrigued by the potential secrets stored within, our team has begun the painstaking process of analyzing the data."
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.name: "Databank Analysis"
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.desc: "To say our scientists are baffled by the contents of the databanks would be an understatement. Upon further examination, the true nature of this vast data repository became clear - every single entry is a complaint regarding the substandard quality of the alloys produced by the Inasir Corporation. The sheer volume of grievances stored here is staggering, reflecting a level of dissatisfaction that rivals the scale of the operation itself."
 scfe_inasir_dig.6.a: "Why did they keep them?"

 scfe_unseen.2.name: "Strange Emission Detected"
 scfe_unseen.2.desc: "Our outpost's sensors in the §Y[scfe_unseen_system.GetName]§! system have detected an unusual anomaly on the surface of §Y[scfe_unseen_planet.GetName]§!. Exotic particles are being emitted at an unprecedented intensity. A science ship must be dispatched to investigate this phenomenon immediately."

 SCFE_UNSEEN_PROJECT_1_DESC: "$scfe_unseen.2.desc$"
 scfe_unseen.3.name: "Planetary Rift"
 scfe_unseen.3.desc: "Our initial analysis reveals that the phenomenon is localized to a single point on the planet's surface. At this site, reality itself appears to be unraveling, as though it is being pushed aside by something emerging from another dimension - something vast."
 scfe_unseen.3.a: "Let's close it before it opens"
 scfe_unseen.3.b: "Let's destroy it before it opens"
 scfe_unseen.3.c: "Let it open."
 scfe_unseen.4.name: "Rift Closed"
 scfe_unseen.4.desc: "Drawing on our knowledge of astral rifts, we have successfully reversed the phenomenon by employing highly charged astral threads. Whatever was attempting to enter our universe has been forced back into its own dimension - hopefully, for good."
 scfe_unseen.5.desc: "We deployed a massive antimatter charge into the rift, and it detonated as planned, destabilizing the anomaly. The dimensional rift collapsed as expected, but the resulting shockwave was catastrophic - so powerful that the entire planet has begun to fracture."
 scfe_unseen.6.name: "Coming from the Rift"
 scfe_unseen.6.desc: "Our continued observation of the phenomenon as it unravels is yielding significant scientific data, keeping our scientists occupied as they study the rift's expansion. Something is beginning to emerge - a structure, possibly the top of a building - but the sheer size of the rift suggests that many more are likely to break through soon."
 scfe_unseen.7.name: "The City From Beyond"
 scfe_unseen.7.desc: "The structure has fully emerged, and the rift has vanished without a trace. A vast city now sprawls across the barren planet, seemingly constructed by a highly advanced civilization. Yet, there are no energy readings, no signs of life. The city remains eerily silent, beckoning for exploration."
 scfe_unseen.7.a: "Let's explore it."

 scfe_site_unseen_desc: "$scfe_unseen.7.desc$"
 scfe_unseen_dig.1.name: "$scfe_unseen.7.name$"
 scfe_unseen_dig.1.desc: "We have established a camp on a vast plaza within this strange city. The silence is unsettling, with towering buildings encircling us. They appear to be made of polished basalt, yet under certain angles, they shimmer with a faint purple hue. Our instruments are unable to analyze the material - it’s as if it still belongs to its original universe, governed by physical laws that have no place in ours."
 scfe_unseen_dig.2.name: "Strangers in a Strange Land"
 scfe_unseen_dig.2.desc: "As we begin to explore the city, its exotic nature becomes increasingly palpable. Though it hails from another universe, it is we who feel like the outsiders here. Bridges materialize from thin air, only to dissolve once crossed. Doorways appear within seamless walls. Yet, we remain utterly baffled. There is no trace of writing, no buttons, no levers - nothing to interact with. We are like primitives wandering through a high-tech metropolis, a disconcerting experience for scientists from a spacefaring civilization."
 scfe_unseen_dig.3.name: "Out of this World"
 scfe_unseen_dig.3.desc: "We return to our base camp with faint hope. The rest of the team has deployed our most sensitive instruments, initiating a comprehensive analysis of the city. As we suspected, it extends into multiple dimensions beyond our perception. Its systems shift between dimensional variants as needed, as evidenced by the bridges and doors we encountered. We've managed only a fleeting glimpse into the nearest dimensions, but the city's reach extends far beyond what our instruments can currently detect."
 scfe_unseen_dig.4.name: "Threshold of the Unknown"
 scfe_unseen_dig.4.desc: "We are beginning to notice signs of activity around us. Some buildings are shifting their structure, and pathways appear and vanish as if being used - yet we can detect no presence. Once again, the overwhelming feeling that we don't belong here grips us. This city was built for entities beyond our comprehension, and we fear that we could be erased by an automated process - unnoticed, as if we were nothing more than debris in their world."
 scfe_unseen_dig.5.name: "Beyond Perception"
 scfe_unseen_dig.5.desc: "We depart the planet with an unsettling mix of awe and uncertainty. We have crossed paths with a civilization far beyond our understanding, their existence unfolding in higher dimensions beyond our ability to perceive. We will likely never meet them, never see each other, yet we now share the same region of the galaxy. Only time will tell if our technology will one day evolve enough to bridge the vast divide between us - perhaps millennia from now."
